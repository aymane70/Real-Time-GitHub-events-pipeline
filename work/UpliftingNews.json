And most governments succeed \u2014 according to statistics compiled by UNESCO, about 9 in 10 children of primary school age are enrolled.  \n\n\n>The chart shows how this expansion unfolded for boys and girls separately. Throughout most of the 20th century, enrollment rose steadily, but boys remained more likely to be in school than girls.  \n\n\n>It was only towards the end of the century that this gap began to close.

Benozzi\u2019s study suggests that eye drops (containing pilocarpine and diclofenac) may improve near vision, but the study design means the results may not apply to everyone. Long-term pilocarpine use can sometimes cause side effects such as reduced night vision, dimmer vision in low light, eye strain, irritation and, in rare cases, retinal detachment, while prolonged topical NSAID use may pose corneal risks.

In the wild, only around 1% of hatchlings survive due to predation.\n\n\n\nIt represents a major step in a long-term project to restore European pond turtles in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a province, where they are considered extinct. Around 150 turtles are expected to be released into two landscape parks in the province over the coming years.\n\nThe programme, run jointly by the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Orientarium Zoo and several regional institutions, raises young turtles in controlled yet naturalistic conditions to protect them from predators during their most vulnerable early years.\n\nThe hatchlings are brought to the zoo from Polesie National Park in eastern Poland, where a successful breeding programme has helped establish the country\u2019s largest European pond turtle population, estimated at around 1,500.\n\n\n\nThey then spend three years in specially prepared indoor enclosures designed to mimic natural conditions while keeping out threats such as foxes and\u00a0[raccoons](https://notesfrompoland.com/2022/04/29/racoon-resists-rescue-attempts-after-falling-asleep-on-a-streetlamp-in-poland/).\n\nThe turtles are exposed to fluctuating temperatures, sunlight and natural UVB, and must find food themselves \u2013 measures designed to maintain their instincts for survival in the wild.\n\nTwo cohorts of 50 turtles have already been brought to the zoo, in September 2024 and September 2025. The first group has achieved a 100% survival rate, with the university reporting that the turtles \u201chave grown significantly and are in excellent condition.\u201d\n\n\u201cBigger equals safer,\u201d the university\u2019s department of biology wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cBreeding allows the young to grow larger, which dramatically increases their chances of survival once released into the wild.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnce common across central Poland, the European pond turtle declined sharply due to habitat loss, water pollution, wetland drainage and predation by invasive species. The turtles were placed under strict protection as early as 1935 and are now threatened with extinction.\n\nThe long-term goal of the project is to rebuild self-sustaining wild populations and restore the species\u2019 presence in the region.\n\n\u201cThe European pond turtle has disappeared from our region mainly due to human activity \u2013 wetland drainage, pollution and predation.

However, there are significant study limitations:  no controls and a (stated) conflict of interest.*\n\nSimpler language version:\n\n### Study Intro\n\nLead Researcher:  Zhu (salaried employee of Novavax and holds stock)\n\nPublished\n- [Oct 21, 2025, Journal of Medical Virology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.70645)\n- [Jan 2025 preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.21.25320906v1)\n\nStudy size:  347 (human)\n\n- When evaluating vaccines, most studies measure  IgG (immune response in **blood**), but IgA (the body\u2019s immune response in **mouth and nose** (saliva and mucus) is more potent to protect against early covid infection.  This study measured IgA in saliva.\n\n- Participants:  had received 2 or more mRNA vaccines\n\n- Study protocol:  Saliva collected prior to receiving Novavax and again 28 days later. \n\n- Results:  increase in IgA against 4 variants (XBB.1.5, JN.1, Wuhan, and Wild) an indicator of **broad spectrum** cross-variant protection.\n\n### Study Summary\n1. Rapid responses in mouth and nose (saliva and mucus) are key in fighting the virus and **reducing transmission** (viral shedding) \n2. Recommendation:  nasal spray vaccines, for a localized IgA response where the virus enters the body.  \n3. We need more studies focused on **mucus IgA** (to take advantage of its strengths, improve immune responses, increase long-term cross-reactivity, and define ideal levels) \n\n###Author states these study limitations:\n- Participants did not represent a broad age range (only age 12-17 represented)\n- Relatively small study\n- Though this study recommends nasal vaccines, the study did not evaluate effectiveness of nasal spray vaccines.\n\n(*I notice a study limitation not mentioned in the published study:   study design did not compare Novavax to mRNA and did not include controls.*)", "date_utc": 1761310177.0, "title": "Encouraging covid vaccine study results", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "score": 84, "url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.70645"}, {"id": "1oemg4i", "name": "t3_1oemg4i", "content": "The three holdout landowners have been overruled and the sanctuary will be put in, possibly just in time for thirty belugas at Marineland who need a new home.", "date_utc": 1761273642.0, "title": "Nova Scotia grants Crown land lease for would-be whale sanctuary", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "score": 505, "url": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/nova-scotia-grants-crown-land-lease-for-would-be-whale-sanctuary-9.6948237"}, {"id": "1oe2k6x", "name": "t3_1oe2k6x", "content": "", "date_utc": 1761224229.0, "title": "App that translates speech to sign language in real-time wins top innovation prize", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "score": 1740, "url": "https://www.cnn.com/world/africa/speech-to-sign-language-app-wins-africa-innovation-prize-spc?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=missions&utm_source=reddit"}, {"id": "1oe1ld4", "name": "t3_1oe1ld4", "content": "", "date_utc": 1761221496.0, "title": "How an Oregon writer finds fulfillment in picking up litter -- \"No one can do everything, but everyone can do something.\"", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "score": 1234, "url": "https://www.npr.org/2025/10/22/nx-s1-5470168/how-an-oregon-writer-finds-fulfillment-in-picking-up-litter"}, {"id": "1oe5p8d", "name": "t3_1oe5p8d", "content": "", "date_utc": 1761231863.0, "title": "Michigan woman, 80, becomes oldest woman to hike Appalachian Trail", "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "score": 651, "url": "https://www.woodtv.com/news/montcalm-county/michigan-woman-80-becomes-oldest-woman-to-hike-appalachian-trail/"}, {"id": "1oe6dps", "name": "t3_1oe6dps", "content": "", "date_utc": 1761233438.0, "title": "Quick-Thinking NYPD Officers Rescue Choking Infant in Richmond Hill Home", "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "score": 129, "url": "https://www.womenzmag.com/local-news/nypd-officers-rescue-choking-infant/"}, {"id": "1odikus", "name": "t3_1odikus", "content": "", "date_utc": 1761162684.0, "title": "This town wants to give away its 100-year-old convent.
