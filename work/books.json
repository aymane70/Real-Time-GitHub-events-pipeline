I am not a prude, but some themes the book explores would likely be enough to make even more sexually liberated individuals than myself feel squeamish. If you know, you know.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's not a bad book, I am neither trashing the story nor the Melchor's competent writing.

If you want to explore the depths of human depravity, yeah, go ahead. I just picked it up because it's among r/truelit's favorites, and nothing in the blurb prepared me for the contents. I'm glad I read it, but it's the type of experience you'd only want to go through once.\n\nBonus lighthearted eyebleach ending - at first, I accidentally got another book called Hurricane Season by Lauren K. Denton. Started reading that one and was confused by the simple prose and warm themes. Turns out it's a kind of feel good chic lit about finding oneself lol.

Now, I'm not so sure.\n\nI've been dealing with a lot of grief recently. So, I think my decision making was very poor.\n\nI had in mind that a book like Dante's Inferno would be good for my mental health, but I was slightly mistaken. And by slightly I mean that I made a gargantuan mistake.\n\nWhereas a book like Dante's Inferno focuses on redemption and personal growth, A Short Stay In Hell does the complete opposite.\n\nDespair, hopelessness, meaninglessness, sadness, depression... I can't even begin to explain how well the book does existential horror. I didn't even know that was a thing!\n\nAnd yes, despite the horrors I just read, I'm glad I did. I just wish it had been under better circumstances.\n\nIf your mental health is fragile, please don't read this short novel. Fortunately for me, my MH is good. Otherwise, this book would've destroyed me.\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for your nice comments. After a good night of sleep I no longer feel drained.\n\nI'd also like to add some context. Yesterday, I had to put down my dog, and it was awful. I've known about it for 3 weeks. And so, I was looking for some kind of beacon of hope. Unfortunately, it came in the form of A Short Stay In Hell. So, yeah... Poor choice of book.\n\nFortunately, I'm an atheist. And so, I don't believe in an endless hell in the form of a library. The funny thing is that, even though I shouldn't have been affected by it, it actually shooketh me and my system of beliefs. Just a little bit.\n\nIn any case, I feel better now. I find myself appreciating more the ephemeral beauty of our world, precisely because it's ephemeral.\n\nI would very much like to read everyone's recommendations and reply to everyone in the comment section, but let's face it, just like the characters in the book, it would be pointless.

And some of his reflections are quite deep.

Did I like it? Did I not like it? I genuinely don\u2019t know.\n\nThe ending definitely left me dissatisfied \u2014 there\u2019s no denying that. But the overall reading experience? I\u2019m certain I\u2019m better for it. \n\nThe story takes place on a strange island where things begin to disappear. It starts with small objects like hats and roses and slowly moves to bigger, more vital things \u2014 even parts of one\u2019s body. When something disappears, the islanders are left with only a vague sense that *something* is gone, but they can\u2019t identify what it was. They don\u2019t mourn these things, and they don\u2019t miss them. Except, there are a few people who do remember. And if the Memory Police find anyone immune to the disappearances, they take them away. It\u2019s an intriguing (and rather risky) premise.\n\n>!As I read, I kept drawing parallels. The Memory Police\u2019s oppression reminded me of how the public is often suppressed by those in power. And the islanders\u2019 fear of speaking out felt exactly like the silent fear people feel today when resisting authority. The novel-within-the-novel which is written by the narrator had some interesting parallels too. The narrator\u2019s character loses her voice, just like the islanders have lost theirs. She becomes convinced she can\u2019t survive outside the room she is imprisoned by the lover \u2014 just like the islanders who limit themselves to the restrictions placed on them.!<\n\n>!The islanders not missing the things they lose, and being brainwashed into adjusting their wants and needs can be realted to how easily we accept popular trends and convince ourselves that they\u2019re exactly what we want. And then there is R (the person the narrator hides in a safe room to protect from The Memory Police), becoming thin and pale as he adjusts to his tiny surroundings. That struck something personal \u2014 how we confine ourselves to small environments, settle into comfort zones, and slowly let our minds and bodies shrink to fit them. R didn\u2019t choose to be trapped, but I often get complacent where I am, and that made me think.!<\n\n>!It seemed fairly clear that some kind of experimentation was going on \u2014 something along the lines or genetic research or genome sequencing was mentioned \u2014 and I think that the Memory Police were trying to develop a weapon or technology that could make people forget. The memory glitches, the sudden triggers that bring forgotten things back, the way memories leave \u201choles in the heart\u201d \u2014 all of that felt like the side effects of an imperfect, still-developing technique. But the fact that the author did not feel the need to explain this part, makes me think that her intention is to focus on the emotional part of it all. She isolated us from the logic and the facts -- she didn't even gives us names of people or places -- and all we had to go on, were thoughts and memories (or lack thereof). !<\n\nIt also seems deliberare that the book is painstakingly slow. Nothing significant happened for a long time, and the story felt very repetitive. I almost left it halfway but I picked it back up because I *had* to know what the author possibly intended to do with this story. And when I was done with it, I thought \"Couldn't this have been finished in 10-15 pages? Why did it have to be dragged out so long?\"   \n  \nBut looking back, I think the slowness was intentional. It forces you into the same waiting, the same uncertainty, the same dull frustration the islanders live with every day. It transports you into that world. How else can one be expected to relate to such a bizarre concept?\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't say I throughly enjoyed the book. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who isn't an avid reader. But I suppose I needed it -- like eating a healthy vegetable that you don't necessarily like.\n\nAnd I certainly feel like a little kid fishing for candy, trying to find different people's interpretations of the book. What was your interpretation? I'd love to hear.

Jerome\u2019s humour is light, conversational and wonderfully self-deprecating, turning everyday mishaps into small comedic epics. The realistic dynamic between the three friends (and the ever-judgmental dog, Montmorency) gives the book its warmth.\u00a0\n\nThe real joy is how modern the voice sounds. Jerome\u2019s 19th century observations about laziness, overthinking, ego and friendship feel relatable even in 2025. His descriptions of the Thames are unexpectedly lovely too, grounding the comedy in a peaceful travelogue.\n\nThat said, the book can feel episodic and some jokes stretch longer than they need to. I personally liked the constant tangential digressions into side anecdotes but may not appeal to some readers.\u00a0\n\nTaken as a whole, its an easy, pleasant and surprisingly timeless read, gentle humour that doesn't try too hard, a river journey that doubles as an escape from everyday life and a narrator who knows exactly how ridiculous he is.\u00a0\n\nA classic worth dipping into when you want something comforting, witty and quietly delightful, that feels like listening to a group of mildly incompetent funny friends tell stories over a hang.\n\n8/10", "date_utc": 1763282001.0, "title": "Three Men in a Boat by Jerome K.

But I\u2019m so glad I did. \nAnd as I mentioned in a previous review, I prefer Aragorn to Thorin as a king and this book absolutely confirmed that for me. The man radiates strength without the ego. I also walked away from this one with a new respect and love for Pippin and Merry. They were definitely more than I expected, not just the comedy duo anymore, but real heroes in their own right.\nAnd I might get hate for this one, but as much as I love Frodo, I think Sam is the real hero of this tale.

But I know the culture was different when Tolkien wrote this, and that it was a lot more acceptable for men to be openly affectionate platonically. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Still, the thought was there. And having never seen the movie adaptation of this part of the story, I actually had no clue how it would end. I fully expected Frodo to complete his quest himself\u2026 so when I read who actually completed the mission, my jaw dropped.\nRIP Golem\n(Btw I\u2019m going to do a movie marathon and watch all of the Hobbit and Lotr movies now.)\n\nI also thought the story would end right after the war was over and the Ring destroyed, in the typical \u201cclimactic finish.\u201d But I was pleasantly surprised that it didn\u2019t just fade to black. The final chapters made me feel warm and oddly fulfilled. Tolkien really took the time to tie up loose ends and bring everything full circle, and  I actually loved that. The promises kept by Legolas and Gimli were fun to see, the coronation was beautiful of course, but what really stuck with me was the cleanup and rebuilding of the Shire. Knowing some of Tolkien\u2019s work was written during the war, it made so much sense. The restoration, the healing, it meant more.\n\nMy heart ached for Frodo, seeing how he never fully recovered, and for Bilbo too. But I\u2019m really glad Sam got his happily ever after because he truly earned it. All in all, the story was fantastic. \u201cA truly 1420 experience \ud83d\ude0c.\u201d \nI even read some of the lore attached to the back of the book, and it connected a few dots for me. Definitely one of my favorite series now. \n\nP.S.

He is a complete absolute bore. I cannot live vicariously through him. I cannot empathize with him. His personality puts me at odds with him, I would not want to meet or know him in the real world.\n\nBut that said, Linus Baker is exactly the person that the children in the book needed in their lives. I don't think the author picked poorly for this reason. And over the course of the book he was able to grow into a normal and average human being rather than whatever husk he was at the start.\n\nIt felt rather unnecessary having magical creatures. I'm not sure what their purpose was -- to make it less difficult to read about child trauma by divorcing it from reality? -- Or to avoid touching on difficult topics that actually result in children facing discrimination? The magical aspects of the story really added nothing to it for me, it kind of just made the entire story feel irrelevant.\n\nDespite everything, I somewhat enjoyed this book, and it does rest in my mind after finishing it, and not knowing fully why I actually finished it and have this book in my mind is part of what makes it worthwhile, and what makes writing about it worthwhile.\n\nSuper keen to hear the thoughts of others.\n\nPS.

Could this be nature, nurture, or something more beneath the surface?\n\nAfter some brief cultural clashes (some I really relate to, like the bit about parenting), Winnie dives deep into the traumatic story of her life amidst WW2 and living in a patriarchal, collective society. All this is for her own closure and to be upfront to Pearl on>!who her real father is.!<\n\nWinnie is the titular Kitchen God's Wife. Just like in the OG legend, her sacrifices and support are forgotten and she gets no chance of honour unlike the Kitchen God and her charismatic but deadbeat husband, Wen Fu.

Helen is presented as the talkative, ditzy, gluttony klutz, but has her own moments where she finally gives back to the relationship mostly carried by Winnie. Helen admittedly has street smarts, such as when she had to rescue Winnie from a panicked riot in Nanking and confronting Wen Fu for the last time. Auntie Du is not just the person we send off in the beginning; she plays a key role to Winnie's freedom from hell.\n\nHelen's memory and narration can be unreliable at times.>!

Why harras them or the fandom? Why flip their content only to make it harder on the employees and why buy the books only to rip, ruin or destroy it.. like this lady had Colleen\u2019s entire collection of books and commented on why she didn\u2019t like them or her.. even if you want to spread the word on why someone may want to dislike someone like that, why get mad at someone for separating the artist from their art? I think it\u2019s kinda hypocritical that people will read or watch Harry Potter even tho the author clearly is aganist trans people even if it is second handed or celebrate jennetts book that doesn\u2019t contain trigger warnings on why her mom was a bad parent growing up on but the minute someone like myself who separates the art from the artist gets thrown under the bus for simply liking the content or having a different opinion about a book that is seen as controversial, i think regardless books should be accessible to everyone as long as it isn\u2019t preaching hate or genoicde and is age appropriate \n\nAlso one more thing before I repeat myself again, I am not certain about this statement I am about to say so please take this with a grain of salt but don\u2019t publishers and book stores have more say over where a book should go? If Colleen Hoover did have all authority over where her books should be, where would you want to see her books in a store?

Its closure began so abruptly that many libraries are now dealing with canceled orders, interrupted services, and competition to onboard with new vendors as quickly as possible.\n\nWhile many of the Philadelphia region\u2019s library systems used B&T as a distributor, the systems varied in how much they relied on it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real disruption for us,\u201d said Tierney Miller, library director of Cherry Hill Public Library, which used B&T as its vendor almost exclusively for books, audiobooks, DVDs, and other materials for about 30 years. \n\nB&T is planning to wind down its business by the end of the year and has already laid off over 500 employees, as reported by 404 Media. The distributor, which has been operating for nearly 200 years, was the subject of several recent acquisitions, but a proposed September deal ultimately fell through. \nJude McSenn, 2, browses the books while his nanny Tarryn Pietersen looks on at the Philadelphia Free Library Parkway Central Branch in Philadelphia, Pa. on Wednesday, November 30, 2022.

Libraries are increasingly filling the holes of the public safety net.\n\nAnny Laepple, director of Delaware County Libraries, learned about the closure through a Facebook group for librarians. Delco\u2019s library system relied heavily on B&T overall, though its 28 library locations operate independently and used the distributor to different extents.\n\nEven though some branches had already been transitioning to other distributors because they\u2019d noticed a decline in B&T\u2019s quality since the pandemic, she said, the timing was still shocking.\n\n\u201cMany of them have been using Baker & Taylor for years and years. So they are now scrambling to meet the demand for materials\u201d she said.\n\u2018Far-reaching ripples\u2019\n\nOnboarding with a new library distributor is not as simple as placing orders on one website versus another.\n\nCherry Hill librarians had orders with B&T that had yet to be filled, Miller said. But orders have gotten canceled and removed without warning. Miller likened it to filling an online shopping cart with 10 items, but then only seeing seven, and having to figure out what went missing.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re limping along,\u201d she said about the distributor. \n\nB&T provided other services besides book purchases, too. Delaware County\u2019s branches would often pay a little bit extra to B&T for mylar covers for new books that would protect them and extend their lifespan, Laepple said. Now, Delco\u2019s librarians are doing that work themselves. Delco\u2019s vendor behind its online catalogue subscribed to a B&T service that provided cover art, professional reviews, and other data for books. \n\n\u201cThe closure definitely had far-reaching ripples, not just the books,\u201d Laepple said.\n\nThe Free Library of Philadelphia used B&T to purchase a third of its new printed book inventory last year, or about 40,000 books, according to spokesperson Mark Graham. But he did not expect B&T\u2019s closure to have a major impact on the Free Library\u2019s inventory.\n\n\u201cWith our multiple distributors, we are working with the other vendors to add capacity for future requests. The closure of B&T did not put the Free Library in a position where we were unable to purchase books,\u201d Graham said via email. \n\nThe Bucks County Free Library system, though, is clear that they expect some disruption for patrons. In a new page published to its website on Monday, the library said B&T was its \u201cmain source for new books\u201d and asked for patience as it looked for new distributors.\n\nBut not all local libraries used B&T. The Lower Merion Library System, for instance, said it did not use the distributor and would not be affected. \nOverwhelming demand\n\nOther library distributors left with B&T\u2019s ex-clients were not prepared for the flood of demand. B&T had a major competitor in Ingram Content Group, and there are dozens of other smaller distributors in the industry.\n\nThe onboarding process with new vendors is taking longer than it normally would, Laepple said. A couple of branches in the Delco system are in a queue with their new distributors, she said, waiting until the distributor is ready to take their orders. \n\nIn the meantime, some libraries are working to fill the gaps with Amazon Business\u2019 newly launched library hub, or Barnes & Noble. \n\nCherry Hill was lucky and doesn\u2019t expect delays in getting new inventory. It was already a client of another distributor, Brodart, which the library used sporadically while B&T handled the bulk of its orders. Brodart told Cherry Hill it was otherwise not taking on new clients, since the demand in B&T\u2019s wake has been overwhelming. \n\nFor those within the library and librarian community, B&T\u2019s closure felt like a major loss and has left a \u201chuge crater,\u201d Miller said. Librarians had built long-term relationships with the company and its employees over the years. \n\nB&T\u2019s shutdown is likely to make library patrons appreciate the logistical work it takes to make books available to visitors for the first time, Miller said. \n\n\u201cA lot of people take for granted that there are books on the shelves of their libraries ... I know I did,\u201d she said.\n\n", "date_utc": 1763034401.0, "title": "Library book distributor Baker & Taylor shutdown", "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "score": 370, "url": "https://share.inquirer.com/RbvpnX"}, {"id": "1owlx5t", "name": "t3_1owlx5t", "content": "The book has a lovely premise - the undersea cables that connect our internet, and the boat crew that finds and repairs them when they break.

And I remember being pretty freaked out and terrified at the iconic scenes of the possessions, the practical effects, and the chaotic horror elements towards the second half of the movie. I didn\u2019t know that the movie was based on the novel of the same name for a long time until I was looking through a random website's top tier list of the best classic horror books ever written a bit ago. I then picked up a hardcover copy of Amazon about three years ago and have just now, this past week, been reading the book.\u00a0\n\nThe book\u2019s plot focuses on two main characters and switches between their perspectives every one to few chapters. Chris is a struggling actress who longs to be a director, but her beloved daughter, Regan, starts to fall ill and starts showing signs of abnormal behavior that slowly reveals itself to be something far more malevolent and supernatural than Chris is willing to admit to herself. And Father Karras, a struggling Jesuit, who\u2019s at constant battle within himself over his decaying religious beliefs of faith and the naturalistic world that surrounds him with nothing but pain and misery. As being non-religious myself, I wasn\u2019t sure how I would enjoy the more religious heavy aspects of the book, but it was written in an interesting, informative, and non-dense way where I was able to grasp the gist of the faithful and psychological effects of Karras and understand how the religious aspects tied into the horror plot without feeling preachy to the reader. Also in the second half, an extra layer of mystery is added as a detective, Kinderman, gets wrapped up in the plot as well and adds an extra layer of noir mystique to it. Continuing to build up the sense of mystery and the unknown that keeps the reader in the dark of what's real, psychological, or supernatural.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m actually surprised at how much I enjoyed the book overall and how disturbing/graphic/vulgar the writing was at some points, considering it was written in (1971). Now I can\u2019t really give a favorable comparison to the movie, as it's been such a long time since I\u2019ve seen it, but reading through the iconic parts in the book gave me some flashbacks to the movie. From what I can remember, the movie seemed pretty faithful to the book with some minor differences here and there, but the overall tone of build up, suspense, and dread was really well done. The uneasiness and horror started pretty early in the first few chapters, and no chapter or side plot ever felt filler or wasted as it all tied into the demonic plot that all fell back on Regan and her mother.\u00a0\n\nNow, I can\u2019t say I ever got truly *scared* from the book, since I\u2019ve seen, listened, and read quite a bit of horror media over the years. And the supernatural elements are definitely nothing that hasn\u2019t been done many times over since the book has been published, but I can still appreciate how influential it has been on the supernatural/possession genre as a whole. And I definitely got a sense of dread a few times and felt my heart starting to race on a few sections, but nothing nightmare inducing. If you're looking for a horror book that's on the supernatural side of things, I would definitely recommend picking this up to add to the collection of well-written classical horror.\u00a0\n\nWhat was the first experience you\u2019ve had with The Exorcist (Book or Movie)?

And I'm genuinely thinking of dropping it.\n\nI know I've just started, but usually when reading I expect to have a reason to either trust the book and keep on going or have a reason to read on. But so far it's been nothing if the book continues with stupid actions by commanders, with Jack being the only competent leader with the alliance being made to look too stupid to the point of being annoying, then I don't see what's so great about reading it.\n\n", "date_utc": 1762876152.0, "title": "In the The Lost Fleet: Dauntless by Jack Campbell, are there any other competent commanders other than John 'Black Jack' Geary.", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "score": 11, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1oucw7x/in_the_the_lost_fleet_dauntless_by_jack_campbell/"}, {"id": "1otdnue", "name": "t3_1otdnue", "content": "", "date_utc": 1762781100.0, "title": "'It opened up something in me': Why people are turning to bibliotherapy", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "score": 1177, "url": "https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250616-how-bibliotherapy-can-both-help-and-harm-your-mental-health"}, {"id": "1ou4h46", "name": "t3_1ou4h46", "content": "I have just finished\u00a0*The Magus*\u00a0and I am absolutely baffled.

Apologies in advance, this one will be a little long.\n\nFirst and foremost, it's plain and simple that this series will not be for everybody. I think the average reader (by which I mean preferences for writing style/characters/plot/etc, not average skill) is most likely to think book 1 *Annihilation* is the best of the bunch, probably by a fair margin. I think that's probably also my opinion as well, book 1 was phenomenal for my tastes, but I want to expand upon my perspective as somebody who was entranced by the rest of the series as well.\n\n*Absolution* is almost 100% a prequel. I say almost 100% because due to the perspective of Saul the lighthouse keeper that we got in book 3 *Acceptance*, about 1/3 of *Absolution* occurs after all of Saul's POV in that book.\n\nVanderMeer's writing style is a little tough to digest. It's so incredibly descriptive, often hyperbolically so, to the point where it's not always easy to follow the sentence from start to finish. It feels a bit like a schizo-ADHD fever dream, where even the narrator finds themselves incredibly distracted and hyperfocuses on the minute details that otherwise don't feel particularly important.\n\nFor many readers, I can see this as being a MAJOR downside to the readability. For a while, I felt that way too. Then I started to think of it as its own sort of literary device, and while I wouldn't say that made it more *clear* to read, I would say that it made it far more immersive for me. \n\n**Old Jim's Section**\n\nI thought this section did a really interesting job of providing some key background and personality information towards three incredibly important secondary characters, Jack Severance, Henry Kage, and Whitby Allen. \n\nIf you've read the other three books in the series at this point, you know to expect layers upon layers of manipulation from Jack Severance. And perhaps it was na\u00efve on my part to still feel a little blindsided by what came up, but nonetheless, the depths of his manipulation upon Old Jim left me positively reeling. I also think it gives significantly more insight to the character Control/John from books 2 and 3, being Jack's grandson.\n\nHenry Kage's role in the book truthfully did not make a whole lot of sense to me. But I say that in a way that makes me very interested to reread the series again later down the line. Because learning a bit more about his actions and motivations which were detached from the goings-on of Saul Evans gave a lot of context that I think will explain his behaviors that we got to witness in earlier books.\n\nThe \"character\" (if it can even be called that) which this book introduced, the \"Rogue\" as Old Jim called it, appears to be foundational to the creation of Area X. And we learned that in addition to being a catalyst for the Dead Town disaster, the Rogue more or less inspired the child version of Whitby Allen to become the adult he turned out to be. Although now that I think about it, we didn't actually learn this until Lowry's section.\n\nThe Rogue appears to be a Central experiment gone wrong, or perhaps right, which Serum Bliss and the S&SB were intended to study the environmental effects of, knowingly or not. It still remains unclear exactly how much Central knows, and also how much Jack Severance is acting of his own accord as a side project. \n\nI might be entirely wrong, but I think as of now, The Rogue was the root cause of Area X in some way. \n\n**Lowry's Section**\n\nFuck. If you've read this fucking book, you fucking know exactly what I'm fucking talking the fuck about.\n\nOkay that's enough, apparently there are over 1200 instances of the word \"fuck\" in its various forms throughout this section of the book alone, which amounts to somewhere close to 150ish pages or so.\n\nWhile incredibly tedious to power through, this completely excessive choice by VanderMeer *does* serve a purpose. Lowry is a self-obsessed stimulant addict with a hero complex, and the usage of \"fuck\" throughout this section can easily be used as a barometer for Lowry's mood. When Area X's influence on him is at its highest, he uses it the least. When he's at his most significantly goal-oriented (relative to Central), he uses it the most. \n\nIt does a really good job actually of channeling the perspective of a stimulant fiend, and one of the unfortunate things about stimulant fiends is that they're ***incredibly annoying***. Nonetheless, getting a first-hand account of the first expedition from one of its two\\* possible survivors was something I was glad to have received. I also found it interesting that there was no mention of the tower from book one, the team didn't appear to have encountered it at all.\n\n\\*Karen Hargraves/Cass appears to have also escaped Area X back into the real world, if we're to believe the stimulant withdrawal hallucinatory perspective of the suit that Lowry had a conversation with at the end of the book. I want to run with the idea that she did in fact get out, because it gives me yet another piece of the puzzle to look out for throughout the series on a reread. \n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nLike I said in the title, this book was like a car crash. It was incredibly chaotic, often hard to follow, and incredibly convoluted, yet somehow I couldn't help myself from being captivated by it nonetheless. If I were to compare it to any of the previous 3 books, oddly enough I would actually say that it probably felt the most like book 2 *Authority*, but with the atmospheric progression into madness of Saul's perspective from book 3. If I were to rank all four books from best to worst based on my first read of them all, it would look like this.\n\n1. *Annihilation*\n\n2. *Acceptance*\n\n3. *Absolution*\n\n4. *Authority*\n\nI'm going to be thinking about this series for a long time. I'll definitely let it simmer for a while before revisiting it, but I greatly look forward to revisiting it when the time comes, to see what else I can learn on a second round through. VanderMeer himself says that he DOES include every \"answer\" a reader could possibly request from the series, hidden throughout the books at various points.

It\u2019s made Frankenstein an even richer tale to me than it was before I wrote this post. Many of you suggested I read \u201cRomantic Outlaws\u201d so I\u2019ll definitely be checking that out. \n\nI also want to sincerely thank everyone who shared their stories of loss and grief with me. I feel honored that my post resonated with your experiences and helped you in some way. \n\nMany commenters asked me to update with my thoughts on the movie after I watched it. Well I watched it and I definitely have some thoughts lol. If you haven\u2019t seen it, then maybe stop reading here before I spoil something. Overall, I enjoyed it. It\u2019s a visually stunning movie. The acting was incredible from the main characters, Jacob Elordi in particular really knocked it out of the park for me. But whoever told me it was faithful to the source material was pretty far off. I will say, although many of the major plot details were altered, the overarching themes of the book as well as the moral takeaways were carried over well into the film. Instead of it just being a scary monster movie, it was a move about love, loss, grief, loneliness, wrestling with your creator and your purpose, and the questioning of what makes us human. \n\nA commenter told me to keep an eye out for the red hand motif, and I\u2019m glad they did. I think the color red as a whole in the movie represents the continuity and inseparable connection that love, life, connection, and birth has with hatred, death, loneliness, and grief. This is something another commenter touched on when sharing her near death experience while giving birth. The experience helped her realize \u201c\u2026birth/creation isn\u2019t the opposite of death. They are cause and effect, irrevocably linked\u201d. The vibrant red worn by Victors mother was strikingly symbolic. One way cinematic Victor differs from book Victor is that instead of Elizabeth being his greatest source of joy and love, it was his mother. They had each other and only each other. As she goes into labor with William she begins to bleed profusely. Screaming victors name in pain and terror, she reaches for him and leaves a large bloody handprint on his pristine white shirt, and this is the last time we see Victors mother alive. As her corpse is carried in it\u2019s coffin, her face is adorned with bright red fabric. After her death victor is seen wearing mostly black and white with a red scarf worn by his heart, to me symbolic of keeping his mother\u2019s memory close to him. There is a scene where he is scorned and beaten with a stick by his father, whose cruel treatment he imitates toward his own \u201cson\u201d.  After this scene his obsession with eternal life is born, to \u201cfollow life into its hiding places\u201d becomes his life\u2019s goal. He is visited in his dreams by a red angel surrounded by fire, urging him towards his divine purpose. He stops wearing red on his chest and instead wears it on his hands, using his grief and love for his mother, as well as his hatred for his father, to motivate his hand in his work. He continues his work with jubilant, unreasonable, and unrestrained passion, and when his work is done, the monster comes to life, he takes off his red gloves. Cinematic victor is not immediately horrified by his creation, but enamored with his creation in a way that is very narcissistic. He has tender moments with his creation, much like a proud father with his infant son. but his pride is more in himself than in his own creation. Seeing the creature as a reflection of himself, he quickly begins to have expectations for his creation that are unreasonable, much as his own father had for him. The mood between him and his creation has a very sudden and clear shift during a scene when the creature dumbly grips a sharp blade, cutting his hand. Instead of being concerned for the creatures well being, Victor\u2019s angered with him. Victor harshly scolds him and blames him for his own pain. And this is the first time you see the creature have a glimpse of and anger back towards Victor. The creature opens his palm to expose a bright red hand covered in blood and stands up, towering over Victor in a small display of power and defiance. Victor has successfully transferred his grief, his pain, his anger, onto his creation. Now his creation wears the red hand, and though the blood washes off, from this moment it lives inside him forever. When Victor finally abandons his creation, he sets fire to the mansion with the creature trapped inside. The statue of the red angel is surrounded in flames, as the creature screams victors name in terror and pain, just as Victors mother had done. \n\nIn later scenes red is mostly representative of death and rage. Lots of blood. And more blood. And some more. A jaw here, a leg there, a skinned wolf draped over yonder. \n\n\n I think the depiction of Frankensteins monster as a character and not necessarily his actions was very faithful to the source material. I think the monster was definitely my favorite part of the movie. His innocence and tenderness, his confusion and his love, all being soured into rage, was very touching. The literary creature is much more hateful, vindictive, and intentionally murderous than the cinematic creature. The cinematic creature seems to murder mostly in self defense or in a fit of rage, not a calculated homicide. Nonetheless, the essence of his humanity was very well preserved and served its purpose. I think it was an interesting choice to dehumanize Victor so intensely, literary Victor had a much more tender heart, capable of love and understanding, but his blindspot was certainly his creation. In the book you do have sympathy for Victor, but in the movie, I felt almost none of that at all.  I think cinematic Victor was honestly just plain vile and I really hated him. His sudden change of heart as he is dying and listening to his creatures tale gave me whiplash. I think it was touching, and it gave a very tidy heartwarming end to the story, but it seemed very out of character for this cinematic portrayal of Victor. \n\nI felt a little offended by how they altered Elizabeth\u2019s story but overall, I think it worked for the movie. I think it\u2019s interesting how she kind of became a substitute for the monsters companion since cinematic Victor refused to make him one. \n\nWith how many creative liberties they took, I was afraid they wouldn\u2019t include the monsters time in the woods with the De Lacey\u2019s. I really enjoyed how they reimagined this for the screen and allowed a deeper friendship to form between the blind old man and the creature. The addition of the wolves and how it helped to shape the monsters perception of the world was particularly brutal and heartbreaking. I think it worked very well with the story.  \n\nLike I said, overall I really enjoyed it. My expectations for some reason was that it would be very much like the book, so I think i was a little disappointed that it wasn\u2019t. Much of the plot and the characters were drastically changed. Had I not been expecting a faithful rendition, I think I wouldn\u2019t have been disappointed at all. It really is a fantastic film, with very clear intentional thought and direction. The visual symbolism was beautiful. The characters were captivating. The costume and set design truly transported you to a different world, with just enough of the avant guarde artistry Guillermo Del Toro\u2018s films are so famous for. The movie was thoroughly entertaining and in all honesty if it was another hour longer I wouldn\u2019t mind a bit. \n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n\nWith the release of Guillermo Del Toro\u2019s Frankenstein I\u2019m seeing a ton of talk about its source material. Mostly conversations about the portrayal of Frankenstein\u2018s monster and how it seems so different in Guillermo Del Toro\u2019s portrayal than any other cinematic portrayal before. I\u2019m seeing a lot of talk from people saying the movie is very theatrical and out of this world, but still faithful to its source material. I haven\u2019t seen the movie yet, but one aspect that I hope it retains from the source material is grief. I never see anybody talking about Mary Shelley\u2019s grief and how it inspired so much of her book, but to me Frankenstein IS a book of grief and all the different hideous forms it can take. \n\nI\u2019ve read Frankenstein a few times. The first time I read it I didn\u2019t really know anything about Mary Shelley or her life. My take away was that it is a book questioning the very nature of humanity. What makes us human? Is God a loving God? And is life really worth living if you are not connected with others? The second time, I read it with the knowledge that it was written while Shelley was still grieving the loss of her baby. She was young and had given birth to her first baby less than a year before writing Frankenstein. The baby\u2019s name was Clara. Clara was born two months premature and she only survived a few weeks before passing away. Prior to writing Frankenstein, Mary Shelley is said to have had recurrent bittersweet nightmares of bringing Clara\u2019s corpse back to life using an external source of energy, such as the warmth from a fire or sunlight. Sound familiar? \n\nShelley is both Frankenstein and his monster. As Frankenstein she is a creator. She brought life into this world, only for this little life to suffer. For it to be born two months early, the image of such a premature baby is not the same as looking at a healthy baby. Just as looking at the monster is not the same as looking at a regular man. You instantly see there is something wrong with it. Too small, it\u2019s skin transparent, oddly proportioned, it\u2019s movements strained, and though it is your own creation, your own baby, it can fill you with fear. I know suffering from grief you also feel an undue sense of guilt. Frankenstein abandons his creation. And this is just speculation, but Mary did have a nurse maid for Clara and was not her sole caretaker. This was absolutely common practice during the time. Something that Mary did that was rather unconventional was breast-feeding her own children. Typically only people living in poverty breast-fed their own children, everyone else hired nursemaids. Mary Shelley still hired a nurse maid to do most of the caretaking for her babies, but she would step in to breast-feed them. When reading Frankenstein, I wondered if Dr. Frankenstein\u2018s abandonment of his creature is a reflection of Mary Shelley\u2018s guilt for not being there during all of her daughters last moments. She had an intimate bond with her baby from breast-feeding, but I wonder if she found herself avoiding spending too much time with the baby. I can see how the knowledge of its likely imminent death was too difficult for her to endure. Experiencing grief myself, I know that in my loved ones last moments, I felt it very difficult to be around them, and I have feelings of guilt and terrible shame for abandoning them. It is haunting and although you can run and immerse yourself in the world as best as you can, that grief will always follow you, just as Frankensteins monster haunted him. As I\u2019m sure the memory of Clara haunted Mary.\n\n As the monster, Mary is angry with God for bringing her into this world to suffer so much loss. She feels abandoned by God and by those around her. If you\u2019ve ever experienced grief, you may have also experienced a sense of isolation. No one wants to come near you. No one knows what to say. Your grief makes people too uncomfortable because its so ugly. Your grief reminds them of their own mortality, and most people really don\u2019t like the idea of that at all. In the 19th century western world, you were given a mourning period, and then expected to move on with your life. But grief isn\u2019t that simple, it doesn\u2019t evaporate when you take off your black dress. You conceal it and carry it around with you. You have to learn how to be in the world all over again. Wearing a mask of civility all the while feeling hideous inside. When you fully reveal your grief to others, they are horrified. Just as the family in the woods were horrified when the monster revealed himself to them. All he was looking for was connection, compassion, love, acceptance, and understanding, but his true self was too ugly and he was rejected. It was only when he hid himself and made himself useful for them that he was appreciated. You can\u2019t expect time to stand still when you\u2019re grieving. You have to hide it and continue to make yourself useful for others. And you\u2019re looking at the rest of the world with so much envy and contempt. How they float through the world beautifully, smiling, and you want to be a part of it so badly, but your grief is too ugly for them, and you grow to hate them for rejecting you. Your misery makes you a fiend and you feel that only divine intervention, or in Marys case maybe another child, can make you whole again, just as Frankenstein felt his only chance at happiness was begging his creator to make him a companion. \n\nBoth Frankenstein and his monster reminisce fondly of sweeter, simpler times. For Frankenstein, growing up with his beloved Elizabeth. For the monster, admiring and doing good deeds for the De Lacey family. During grief it is easy to get stuck in the past and yearn for when life was bright and beautiful. To yearn for your innocence before you knew your own cruelty as well as the cruelty of others. You can remember a time when you didn\u2019t feel like a monster or a mad man. For Shelley, maybe this was the hopeful optimistic days of her pregnancy with Clara, or the early romantic days of her relationship with Percy. \n\nI think it\u2019s also worth noting that Mary Shelley had a very unconventional relationship with her husband Percy. Percy was married when the two of them met and moved in together. Mary was the young, naive, \u201cother woman\u201d. It wasn\u2019t until Percy\u2019s first wife had passed away that him and Mary were able to get married. By this time, Mary had already given birth to their second child. In addition to their unconventional beginnings, he was extremely unfaithful to her, having several affairs throughout their marriage. During her pregnancy with Clara, he was spending a suspicious amount of time with Mary\u2019s stepsister Claire, and often visited his wife. This has sparked rumors that he was still romantic with his wife and was having an affair with Claire. This is all just to say; I\u2019m very sure the grief of losing a child was greatly amplified by the feeling of having an unsteady marriage.  \n\nThe questioning of human nature, our relationship with our creator, and the purpose of connection with others, are still to me the major over arching themes of Frankenstein. Reading it a second time through the lens of Mary Shelley\u2019s grief and the experience of my own, gave these themes a new life. It was clear to me her horrifying and heartbreaking inspirations are rooted in her grief. \n\nIf you read this far thanks for sticking around. I had fun writing my little essay.

I feel like love is treated as this great justification for anything and everything, this universal truth, you just have to throw this word in there and everything else is a given. It is treated as a complete sentence in itself, but that is hardly enough to write a book.\n\nBut, having read Wuthering Heights, I believe it is about nothing as cheap as \"love\". It is about great emotion, about great passion, but it isn't about love if not in its most irrelevant declination. It is about love in its meanest interpretation, in its ending and in its worn out edges. \n\nTo me the heart of the book lies in its absurd characters: they are so remote from reality that they are completely unique and by that means absolutely irreplaceable. Most are so incredibly hateful that they awaken in me a deep and unparalleled attachment. Hatred is but a facet of passion, and in the end binds as much as love does. \n\nMore than Heathcliff, I have wished for the death of Catherine with the same intensity I missed her presence when she was finally gone. Not once I pitied her and I have never felt for her if not when she expressed how Heathcliff was her outside of her. That was the only declaration of \"love\" I have ever understood \"What were the use of my creation if I was entirely contained here?\"\n\nI was on the fence about Heathcliff. I was afraid he was going to be one of the many tragic characters saved by love and driven mad by the loss of it. But he's just a villain that knew love and wasn't changed (if not in worse) by it. He is a character that doesn't start and finish in his love story, his affection is one and the same with his resentment.\n\nThe greatest strength and the thing that most pains me about this masterpiece is its uniqueness. It cannot be replicated and because of that I will never be able feel like it has made me feel again. \n\nI cannot understand how and why it has gotten its \"mythical status as a love story\", when (at least to me) it simply isn't.

So I decided to read it to see what all the fuss was about. \n\nIt delivered big time. The mystery is not that it was so big then, it's that it isn't bigger now. \n\nProgress and Poverty is a work of political economy which aims to answer the question of why poverty persists despite enormous technological and economic progress. Despite being from 1879 it feels shockingly relevant to today and it's central argument still rings true. \n\nThe crux of the book's thesis is that any growth in productivity is absorbed by land values, allowing owners to charge higher rents and leaving non-owners no better off. This means extreme inequality is the natural result of the private ownership of land and the only way to truly cure poverty is by redistributing land rents with a land value tax.\n\nReading it can be heavy going at times as Henry George dedicates a lot of time to debunking work by contemporary economists, which can feel a little dated now. He's also very thorough in laying out his argument. Sometimes it feels like he's labouring a point for the sake of it but ultimately the argument comes together powerfully and feels stronger for how much time is spent on the foundations. \n\nThe prose is beautiful in places and the moral and economic arguments are compelling. This book completely changed the way I see the role of land in the economy and in particular how it contributes to extreme inequality. I can see why it sparked a movement and birthed the ideology of \"Georgism\"\n\nIn summary, Einstein said it best: \"Men like Henry George are rare unfortunately.

Everyone is mostly analyzing and studying, but not making new things.

It got my attention due to my love for Catch 22. I did\u00a0 find it very funny but for most of the book what really grabbed me was the depiction of a time and place that no longer exists (granted I think there are many exaggerations and fladerizations however I think one can read between the lines and come to a sense of the reality). The characters are also great albeit many are distasteful but in my opinion that is what makes them real. I came away feeling like every character had reason for being the way they were by the end of the book and even their worse attributes made sense and to me very much reflected the reality of how real people live and develop. I think I could discuss every character at some length but for now I will only focus on two.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nJones was my favorite character for most of the book. I really respected Toole\u2019s depiction of him. Toole depicts the reality of his existence and problems in an unflinching way (granted both of us are white). The unfairness and struggle that Jones must endure as black man in the south in 1962 is in the reader\u2019s face and can see why the depiction would\u2019ve been controversial in the period when Toole first sought publication. There are humorous events and circumstances around Jones but Jones himself is not a joke, he is a real man trying to make his way in society which structurally limits his paths forward. I could sympathize with the reader that found the conclusion to Jones\u2019s story to be a bit saccharine or frivolously optimistic but I was happy with the implication that Fortuna was smiling upon him in the end and he would have a chance at a better life.\u00a0\n\nI of course must talk about Ignatius, for most of the book he is the protagonist and main buffoon. He is literally the prototypical neckbeard in a time where in not sure the archetype even existed (that is another one of my main appreciations of the book is Toole\u2019s prefiguring of so many types of people that exists in mass today). He is a fool and luddite, an irrational medievalist promoting a world view that is so arcane and obscure so as to be completely confusing. He lives his life according to Boethius (i am very grateful I had read On the Consolation of Philosophy prior to reading this) and Batman. For the majority of the book I chuckled at Ignatius\u2019s antics without much emotional investment but that changed for a little toward the end. This expert was the first time I began to see him as more than just a joke. \u201cIgnatius felt as alone as he had felt on that dark day in high school when in a chemistry laboratory his experiment had exploded, burning his eyebrows off and frightening him. The shock and terror had made him wet his pants, and no one in the laboratory would notice him, not even the instructor, who hated him sincerely for similar explosions in the past.\u201d He was a man-boy apart who struggled to find genuine companionship and warmth. His dysfunctional family relationship with his mother and absence of father gave him no real safe home. He was only close to his dog which seemingly kept him in reality while it was alive but his dog\u2019s passing and the subsequent dismissal of his grief and mocking of his mourning broke him. I now struggle not to see him as a poor high school boy who retreated into himself after his one friend left him and he was derided for his grief. To me that is the part that explains his world view and dysfunction; a tragic withdrawal to a way of thinking that is so unrelatable it keeps him isolated while also allowing him to understand why it happened (in his mind). In the end Myrna ends up as his salvation because she is the only other person who will engage with his delusions (largely due to her own delusions) without ridicule or dismissiveness. In the end his life only improves by going out in the world and leaving New Orleans to be with someone else in genuine connection (it is not clear to me if there are any romantic connotations to the reunion or not but I don\u2019t think it really matters). Ignatius is mostly a benign man in my opinion who doesn\u2019t seek to do harm but he can be a very reprehensible character at times who lets his trauma drive poor behavior. (is that not the type of person we can see all over the place?) To me this speaks to the contemporary relevance of the book and true solution of the neckbeard type person, they must go into the world and try to form and have connections with others because the only other alternative is perpetual suffering.\u00a0\n\nAt this point, I believe I must also give context for the book's publication because although it was written in 1963, it was not published until 1980 after John Kennedy' Toole's suicide in 1969. The rest of this is taken from Wikipedia from the publication after death section (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kennedy_Toole)\n\n\"After Toole's death, Thelma Toole (his mother) suffered from depression for two years, and the manuscript for A Confederacy of Duncesremained atop an armoire in his former room. She then determined to find a publisher, believing it would be an opportunity to prove her son's talent. Over a five-year period, she sent it to seven publishers, but all rejected it. \"Each time it came back, I died a little,\" she said. However, in 1976 she became aware that author Walker Percy was joining the faculty of Loyola University New Orleans. To get Percy to read the manuscript, Thelma began a campaign of phone calls and letters. Percy complained to his wife about a peculiar old woman's attempts to contact him. With time running out on Percy's term as professor, Thelma pushed her way into his office and demanded he read the manuscript. Initially hesitant, Percy agreed to read the book to stop her badgering. He admitted to hoping it would be so bad that he could discard it after reading a few pages.Ultimately, he loved the book, commenting in disbelief:\n\"In this case I read on. And on. First with the sinking feeling that it was not bad enough to quit, then with a prickle of interest, then a growing excitement, and finally an incredulity; surely it was not possible that it was so good.\"\nDespite Percy's great admiration for the book, the road to publication was difficult. Acceptance took more than three years; he attempted to get several parties interested in it. A Confederacy of Dunces was published by Louisiana State University Press in 1980, and Percy provided the foreword. At his recommendation, Toole's first draft of the book was published with minimal copy-editing, and no significant revisions.\" \n\n\nLastly I want to talk about the author because I think more than most books his life is instrumental in understanding the work. I desperately wish he hadn't killed himself, I would love to know if my interpretations are at all intended. He was a far more productive and functional character than Ignatius but in skimming his biography I think the parallels are evident. He was clearly a brilliant and charismatic man (as seen from accounts of his time teaching) but also had a strong sense of isolation and otherness. Even though the book ends on an optimistic note the fate of the author sharpens a tragic edge to the conclusion. I can\u2019t help but feel the ending is the type of thing he wished would have happened for him but it clearly never did. Someone to see him at his most bare, desperate, and disgusting; someone to still want to help him anyway, someone to see the value and virtues within him despite the grime. (I could very well be wrong on this part but this is my instinct)\n\nTL;DR great book, depicts types of people that are relevant to this day, has a lot more to say about contemporary society than it is given credit for.\u00a0", "date_utc": 1762536893.0, "title": "I just finished A Confederacy of Dunces and I feel compelled to record my thoughts", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "score": 384, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1or0rfk/i_just_finished_a_confederacy_of_dunces_and_i/"}, {"id": "1osgzge", "name": "t3_1osgzge", "content": "\"Zionism: The Birth and Transformation of an Ideal\" by Milton Viorst\n\nI searched this sub and nothing came up, even for the author.

Written by a Jewish man and focused on the leaders of the Zionist movement from the very beginning, it has already shed light on the movement as a whole.

I found it very interesting how a man so out of touch with his religion started the push for a home for the Jewish people. He even considered Argentina as a place to create the homeland. It just shows how little it meant about religion to him and just more about the Jewish \"race\" finding a place to be safe and out from under antisemitism.\n\nI just wanted to mention it because it seems like it's never been talked about on this sub at all.\nAnd so far it has opened my eyes a bit, especially to the different factions of zionists and how they all had different views of the movement.\n\nAnd it just had a price drop so it was well worth it.\n\n\n\n", "date_utc": 1762687437.0, "title": "No Mention of This Book on Zionism", "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "score": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1osgzge/no_mention_of_this_book_on_zionism/"}, {"id": "1or5q08", "name": "t3_1or5q08", "content": "", "date_utc": 1762548238.0, "title": "In 1968 James Watson published The Double Helix, his memoir of how DNA was discovered", "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "score": 159, "url": "https://www.moosejawtoday.com/local-news/book-review-twisting-tale-of-controversey-in-the-world-of-science-10880890"}, {"id": "1orloek", "name": "t3_1orloek", "content": "Welcome readers, \n        \nHave you ever wanted to ask something but you didn't feel like it deserved its own post but it isn't covered by one of our other scheduled posts?

I'm glad I read it because I found it very interesting from a critical perspective but despite how impressive I found the craftsmanship behind the book's construction I doubt I'll ever read it again because I found two-thirds of the book to be quite a slog.        \n    \nSteinbeck is a supreme talent and the book's prose is beautiful. The cast of characters is varied and they all have a purpose in the world that he's trying to create. Some of the chapters that are basically vignettes outside of the Joads do a wonderful job of both describing the moment the novel inhabits and underlining the themes we encounter throughout the Joads' journey. Steinbeck is sometimes a little direct with his messaging - Mrs. Sandry(misandry)'s miserableness comes to mind - but usually strikes the right balance in getting his point across without feeling polemical. Having just read East of Eden I thought the contrast between Ma Joad and that book's female characters was especially striking. Ma is not just a strong female character she is the driving force behind the Joads - though I do think Steinbeck made a curious choice in often showing her strength by having her issue threats of violence which to me seemed to be a strength exposed primarily through masculinization. To be fair, he does take pains to show that she is also wise and not just physically tough.    \n     \nIn many ways I think Grapes of Wrath is greater than East of Eden or at least more skillfully rendered. The deftness with which Steinbeck communicates the core themes of this novel is extraordinarily impressive. Casy's humanist preaching is sharply contrasted with the behavior of other religious authorities and adherents throughout the book including maybe most notably the aforementioned Mrs. Sandry. Tom's crimes of passion and self-defense underscore his sense of justice which stands in stark relief to the venerated crimes of the book's unseen capital class. The third act's proof of the power of collective action, undergirded and built up by the law's fear of even the specter of it throughout the book, was for me far and away the highlight of the novel. The nuts-and-bolts craftsmanship of how Steinbeck put this together really blew me away. I really enjoyed digging into what I thought he was trying to express through this book.        \n    \nI just wish I enjoyed the book itself more. While the skill it took to compose it from a literary perspective was awe-inspiring and helped me to power through the novel in a bit under a week there were large swathes of the book that I found deeply unentertaining. I get that Steinbeck uses the long road trip to build a creeping sense of unease in the family as they near California and it echoes many, many, many, many other epic journeys throughout literary history but fuck it was quite a while spent on the trip - so long that I wonder if John himself got tired of it. It seems almost two-thirds of the trip is getting the Joads from their farm to the edge of Oklahoma and the rest of the trip was mercifully compressed. The colloquial nature of the dialogue was a real drag when the Joads finally did make it to California - Steinbeck likely intended the ubiquitous \"Is there any work here?\" \"Is there any work there?\" conversations to be something of a chorus and meant for it to be repetitive but it was more than I could bear by the end of the novel. I did like the book's third act, but it took a long time to get there. And I hated the ending - it's powerful that Ma and Rose's immediate instinct, when they were more down and out than they had been at any point in the novel, was to give of themselves and to literally give the last of what they had to basically a total stranger but the novel's final point was pretty arresting to me. It almost felt like Steinbeck chose an arbitrary plot point to insert the ending which makes sense from a messaging perspective but was deeply unsatisfying to me. I wouldn't say the book was bad and I'm glad I read it and I would eagerly recommend it to any *writers* but it's hands down the greatest book that I wouldn't recommend to people that mostly read for pleasure.", "date_utc": 1762529067.0, "title": "Grapes of Wrath is the greatest book I've ever read that I didn't enjoy (Spoilers)", "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "score": 367, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1oqxacb/grapes_of_wrath_is_the_greatest_book_ive_ever/"}, {"id": "1oqxsj3", "name": "t3_1oqxsj3", "content": "I just read this book and found it deeply impactful. I\u2019ve seen a lot of discussions about it that take it on its face, however I believe that\u2019s a more fruitful approach is reading it with the same spirit as something akin to Kafka\u2019s Metamorphosis. \n\nWhere the strange scenario described is symbolic of deeper human truths that cannot be effectively captured by describing them directly. The absurdist scenario allows you to inhabit and feel these truths more fully through a narrative.\n\nMy intuition reading the book is that it is a critique of the post-industrialist modernist world, viewing it as a disaster of sorts. Ivan Illich\u2019s work \u201cGender\u201d explores a similar theme where he posits that in post-industrial society, the human was reimagined as a genderless mechanical producer of work. This was a tragedy for all humans who existed within a seasonal cycle that varied according to lengthening and shortening days. But it was a particular tragedy for women who exist in bodies that are aligned even more so than men to this natural seasonal cycle of existence due to their experience of periods and the greater reproductive burden placed on them.\n\nYou can see this in the novel in terms of how nothing is provided to the women to deal with their menstrual bleeding and the randomized, ever changing schedule that is imposed upon, yet also hidden from them, that has no alignment with a regular day/night cycle. This also aligns with how artificial light, ubiquitous in the modern world has disrupted our natural sleep cycles which used to be much longer.\n\nI could go on with this sort of analysis, but just wanted to share this, as I hadn\u2019t seen many of the discussions about the book across the internet look at it in this particular way.\n", "date_utc": 1762530222.0, "title": "I Who Have Never Known Men", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "score": 292, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1oqxsj3/i_who_have_never_known_men/"}, {"id": "1or5id1", "name": "t3_1or5id1", "content": "A very long time, I went a wedding as a child, in a country pub kind of establishment. The bride, dressed in a floaty splotchy kind of blue and pink dress gifted me two thick books when we were leaving: *The Children of the New Forest*, and *The Secret Garden*. They were both hardcover bound in dark crimson red leather (or leather-like stuff, idk), with gilt printing on the cover, one or two full-page coloured illustrations on glossy paper, and a few black and white line drawings- none of which were very good or memorable. The pages were sewn into place with thread. These were the only books like that that I possessed.\n\n(The groom, iirc, was the brother of the then-wife of my mother's uncle.

I did not like *The Children of the New Forest*, the casual cruelty of the children's almost-murder appalled me \"after you kill the rats, you don't leave the little ratlings alive, do you?

I read the blurb and I got intrigued so I decided to give it a try. I admit that based on the title and the blurb, I expected to read a spooky and mysterious story but what I got instead exceeded my initial expectations. \n\nWilkie Collins wove a mystery story that can easily be enjoyed even by modern readers. His writing is simple and it utilizes many Gothic elements in order to add the necessary amount of suspense. Collins took his time setting up the basis of the story and while I could argue that the initial chapters were kinda slow for my liking, I quickly understood their importance in the establishment of the characters and the setting and this, the more I read, the more immersed I got into the story.\n\nThe rich descriptions of the characters and the locations contributed to my vivid experience while I was reading. Picturing the characters and their discussions brought the story to life and helped me envision better the England of the Victorian era. \n\nOne of the main reasons why I found this novel particularly unique in terms of storytelling was the narration. The narration follows an epistolatory format and we see the events unfold through various points of views. The biggest part of the plot is narrated by Walter and Marian but there were some other characters that played a vital role in bringing light to the story. I have never encountered a book like this before and considering the time period it was written, I found this narration style to be very clever and imaginative. I take my hat off Collins for coming up with such an idea and for executing it so well. \n\nThe story was well-plotted and it kept my interest alive for the majority of the book. As the title suggests, the main mystery revolves around \"the woman in white\", whom we get introduced to in the first chapters. Her connection with Sir Percival Glydes, the husband of Laura Fairlie, Walter's student, was a catalyst for the development of the story. Why did she dislike him? What was their relationship? These are only some of the questions that the book arose. \n\nThe story is written in such a way that left no room of plot holes and unanswered questions. Even though we learn little by little about the escalation of the characters and events through the different narrations, each piece of information played a fundamental role in the mystery's breakdown. Even some of the secondary characters got to get involved in this web, despite the fact they didn't get to appear that often. Collins crafted everything meticulously and nothing was done by mere luck. \n\nAnother major factor to my likeness of the novel was the characterisation. All of the characters, even those who appeared to be less interesting compared to others, were well drawn, with distinguished personalities and traits. I was very curious to learn about their motives, backstories and their relationship to the woman in white.\n\nIt goes without saying that my favourite character was Marian Halcombe, Laura's half-sister and one of Walter's students while he worked as a drawing teacher at Limmeridge House, where they lived. Marian is one of the most admirable and resilient female characters I've encountered in books. In an era when women had to be obedient creatures, who ought to listen to what men said, Marian stood up for her sister's sake and refused to bend to Sir Percival and Count Fosco's wishes. \n\nMarian's devotion to Laura moved me a lot. The way she referred to her in her diary entries proved how much she cherished her and how precious Laura was to her. The bond between the sisters was my most favourite dynamic in the novel. Even though we didn't get to see Laura's point of view, through her interactions with Marian and the narration from the other characters, it was evident that she loved Marian as much as Marian loved her. Both of them went to great lengths in order to support each other, especially Marian. \n\nWhile I was reading Marian's part of the story, I couldn't help but admire her for her courage and determination to save her sister from Sir Percival's grip. Despite her status as a woman with no power, which put her at a disadvantage, Marian was outspoken and clever. She carefully crafted her plans and she was observant of everything that happened around her. It was very interesting to follow her narration and I was rooting for her throughout the whole book. She was a strong woman whom I believe deserves a spot in the pantheon of memorable female protagonists in classic books.\n\nMarian was by far one of the best written characters in terms of development, too. At first, she didn't approve of Walter and Laura's love since Laura was to get married to Sir Percival and this, she told Walter to leave for his and Laura's sake. But once she realised that her sister was miserable in her wedding and that Sir Percival was a wicked man, Marian regretted her intervention and began to think of how she could assist her sister while uncovering the mystery behind the relationship between Sir Percival and the woman in white. There were times where Marian was afraid of Sir Percival and Count Fosco but her love towards her sister prevailed and despite the danger, she willingly risked everything. I also appreciated that Marian's relationship with Walter remained platonic. Contrary to popular belief, I didn't want her to end up with him, they worked well as friends and allies and it was refreshing reading about a friendship between a man and a woman which didn't lead to romance. \n\nThe rest of the characters were equally engaging. Even the secondary ones caught my attention, especially the ones that provided more insight to the story. As for Sir Percival and Count Foscoe, they were the type of evil characters whom you hate and yet can't help but pay attention to. Specifically Count For coming was very charming and meticulous, I hated him so much but I almost felt myself getting swayed by him, even though I knew his words were poison. \n\nAnd of course, I shan't forget to mention the woman from whom the novel's title derives from: Anne Catherick. Her backstory and motives troubled me for the majority of the story and her character caught my eye from the moment she got introduced. The more I read, the more I pitied her and I deeply resented everyone who were involved in her mistreatment and who had robbed her off her happiness. \n\nAlthough The Woman In White is a mystery thriller at its core, the book tackled various themes. Considering the time period it was written, the novel does not shy away from portraying the extent of the abuse women received under men during the Victorian era. The book gradually set up Laura's fall to depression due to her husband's schemings and emotional abuse. Not only was she in a loveless marriage, chained to a man who didn't care about her, but her own husband wanted to use her in order to gain money. \n\nIf Collins wanted to rage bait me, he succeeded because I could barely contain my anger while I was trying to get through Sir Percival and Count Fosco's dialogues. The way they spoke of women made me sick to my stomach. They barely valued women as respectable humans who should have been treated with respect. For them, women were mere objects they could toy with and which they could exploit for their own benefit. \n\nReading The Woman In White made me learn more information regarding the rights of women concerning the money they ought to inherit once they got married or not. Furthermore, I realised how misogynistic english society was and how people would always rush to demonize women while uplifting aristocratic men. Sir Percival and Count Fosco were the devils themselves and yet so many people defended them, even when they'd been exposed to their bad side. All of that felt painfully relevant and unfortunately, we still have a long way to go in order to get rid of these behaviors. \n\nThe way The Woman In White dealt with mental illness was remarkable. Taking into account the time period and the stigma around mental illnesses, Collins provided a work that highlighted the exploitation of mental illness, especially when it came to women. Anne Catherick was a very tragic character, one that represented mentally ill people at the Victorian England. Society treated people like her like outcasts, like parasites that needed to be kept away. And women had it the worst because even if they weren't truly mentally ill, their behavior and their outbursts would be attributed to mental issues. Collins showcased that the real villains were people who had power in their hands and who wouldn't hesitate to step on others in order to increase it. \n\nWith all things considered, The Woman In White wasn't a flawless work. I found the story to be less engaging during the last quarter and there were times when the plot kinda drugged. Additionally, I think that Laura's character was underutilized compared to others. We got information about her from other characters but it would have been more impactful if we had seen her own point of view. While I deeply felt for her and her difficult situation, she came across as bland. There were many aspects of her character that could have been explored more. Her suspicion towards Sir Percival and Count Foscoe, her thoughts regarding Anne Catherick, her descent into depression, her love for Marian and Walter. As for the last one, I found the romance kinda poorly developed. Yes, we see that Walter loved Laura and he did everything in order to help her, but I wasn't very convinced about their love. I didn't quite understand why Walter loved Laura. Had his feelings been presented better, the romance would have been more plausible. \n\nIn conclusion, The Woman In White was one of the most pleasant surprises for me this year. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did and I'm happy for giving it a chance. It was a well-crafted story and I'd argue that it has many elements that can be considered progressive and that can provide with food for thought. Readers who appreciate classic literature and a good mystery might find it to their likeness.

Especially one about a story, \"Changeling\", that she initially submitted to Harlan Ellison for Dangerous Visions.\n\nSome of the stories are also part of some of her series like Dragon Riders of Pern and the Ship series. A lot of SF with a little bit of Fantasy, in this case science-fantasy. The stories are highly dramatic, along with a bit of humor tossed in there too.\n\n\"Lady in the Tower\", \"Finder's Keeper\", \"Honeymoon\" and \"The Smallest Dragon Boy\" are the favorites for me here.

But it is so unique, creative and intriguing that I can't stop thinking about it.\n\nTo prevent myself from driving my other half mad as I rant at them, I wanted to lay down some of my interpretation here.\n\nI think this book is about regret, through the eyes of somebody with dementia. I, like many, have direct experience of loved ones with dementia and as I read this book I felt a kind of dawning horror that this is what it must feel like to suffer with it.\n\nRyder struggles with his memory. He forgets to go to events he agreed to and turns up at events he forgot about. He meets people who feel like strangers but who he is simultaneously certain he knows. He watches (or remembers?) 2001: A Space Odyssey but the cast and plot is all wrong.\n\nHe struggles with a coherent sense of time passing. On a couple of occasions he sleeps for what he feels is barely any time but other characters react as if he has slept until a very late hour. It is extremely uncertain when this novel is even set. 2001: A Space Odyssey is on at the cinema, which initially released in the 60s but is a classic so could really have been shown at any time after that. He seems to think his parents are alive, while they are described by other characters as being very elderly when they were around 20+ years ago. Scenes in the present day are often blended with scenery from his childhood.\n\nI think there are also hints that Ryder is in a care home. Almost every building somehow connects to the 'hotel' as if he is never leaving it. He doesn't remember where the hotel is or at first why he is even there.\n\nTo my recollection he never eats anything solid. The academics eat mashed potato, Ryder drinks lots of coffee after which he feels slightly less stressed. Many of the people around him ignore what he is saying and monologue at him, except when they seek to calm him down with many of the physical acts we associate with comforting old people, such as the man on the tram at the end gently patting his leg and telling hik to eat.\n\nI agree with a theory a few people seem to have: that Ryder is also Boris, Stephan and Brodsky. They are the same man at different stages at his life and his sense of time and memory is eroded so far that they elide. This explains why he can recall conversations they had that he couldn't possibly have witnessed himself in the confines of the plot.\n\nBoris and Ryder both like football and seem to have absent, unsupportive parent(s). Stephan and Brodsky both play the piano, as does Ryder. The former again has unsupportive parents, who won't watch him perform (just like Ryder) and commits to lots of international travel at the end of the novel (again, like Ryder). \n\nRyder, as Brodsky, also starts showing memory issues. I noticed he had a peculiar way of speaking at times where he used incredibly general terms for things he presumably couldnt remember in detail: his 'wound' (he has had a leg amputated), an 'animal' (not a dog, or even a pet) etc. \n\nI think through this lens, Ryder is in a care home ruminating over things he regrets. Whether that is a lost toy as a child, being forced to be overly mature by his overbearing parents (reading household manuals, acting like the adult as Gustav dies), or mourning a woman he loved but who didn't love him back. Throughout it all are his parents, who I think within the story are Hoffman and his wife, who he misses and loves and resents all at the same time.\n\nThe ending is highly ambiguous, but vaguely positive. Is he reflecting on his life and concluding it wasnt that bad after all? Is he falling back into delusion? Is he medicated by the people on the tram, who may well be nurses?\n\nAnyway, a fascinating book and I'd love to hear if anybody else thought so too.

In a desperate race against time, the nations of the world unite to build a network of space habitats, hoping to preserve a fragment of civilization beyond the planet\u2019s surface. As politics, science and human nature collide, the survivors must adapt to the harsh realities of space and rebuild society from scratch. \n\nThe world building in Seveneves is astonishingly detailed and grounded in real science, showcasing Stephenson\u2019s ability to construct a future shaped by physics, engineering and human ingenuity, from the frantic construction of orbital habitats to the long term evolution of humanity in space. Every element from propulsion systems and asteroid mining to genetics and social structures, feels meticulously thought out and logically connected. \n\nYet what truly elevates the novel is not just its scientific credibility, but its quiet reverence for human resilience. The characters aren\u2019t melodramatic heroes, they are problem solvers, engineers and scientists doing their best in the face of extinction, employing reason, cooperation and a strong will to endure. This cold self restraint, while making the future generations of humanity a priority gives the story a lot of emotional depth and authenticity. \n\nAt times the prose can feel heavy and the dialogue overly technical.

For me it was very obvious that this whole \"affair\" was not one, it was more likely SA? He was 15 and got \"seduced\" by his 42 year old neighbor. Phrasing it as an affair just plays it down. In my opinion this is the whole premise of the depressed tone of the book, because Istvan is obviously traumatized? Every other intimate relation he has with a woman is reflecting the one he had with his neighbor: They are older, married and from his point of view somehow ugly. I wouldn't say, that this is just his type of woman, I rather think that the experience he made with 15 marked him.\n\nAside from that I felt really uncomfortable reading the intimate scenes with his neighbor. All the other ones he had in his adult life were not nearly described that detailed and since the SA topic was never picked up again in the book (especially as what it is, even not with his therapist?) nor by the author itself in interviews - I wonder why he even wrote about it? I tried to make some research about this but couldn't find anything.

The book I'm reading now has new paragraphs being started in the middle of a sentence. Or a sentence fragment ending ,. Like that. My biggest pet peve is time not making sense. Things that clearly took days to happen being described as happening in a few hours. I have not worked with expensive editors. Just editors a self pub author could afford. And they would have caught these problems. \n\nHas anyone else noticed this? As I wrote this I realized there's a chance this could be AI in the editing process? \n\nETA: I don't notice it nearly as bad in other genres. Like one of my other favorite genres is cozy mystery and it doesn't have the same problem.", "date_utc": 1762178943.0, "title": "Anyone else noticing a decline in writing/editing of fantasy books?", "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "score": 705, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1oncpup/anyone_else_noticing_a_decline_in_writingediting/"}, {"id": "1oogg4a", "name": "t3_1oogg4a", "content": "Spoilers in the post below!\n\nI finished this book this morning. I really enjoyed most of it, but I'm left feeling very unsure how I feel about it now.\n\nIt's the ending of the book. I really didn't feel like the ending... did much. Maybe it not being an ending persay, not wrapping things up neatly, was part of the point of the book thematically. But as a reader I was disappointed that there wasn't a bit more, I don't know, closure? I really wanted Richard and Cynthia to get together - yes maybe that's cliche and maybe again part of the point of the book is that the man and woman he meets in his adventure don't always have to get together. In a way I guess it was realistic - good even - that she also got a fresh start, new lease of life, just like Richard did, just not with him. Either way I guess I kind of wanted them together regardless; thought they were good for each other.\n\nI also felt like things got left part-done with 'the ex wife'. Towards the end I was really hoping Richard and ex-wife wouldn't get back together and at least they didn't, but again, that was left kind of open, and that's a pairing I do not think are good together (although again, I get that thematically towards the end was partly about how families aren't perfect but kind of make do the best they can, and ex-wife's deeprooted fear of thinking about anything meaningful - to the extent she kept too busy for anything including emotional closeness - was a foil for Richard's newly found appreciation for closeness and community).\n\nI get that a lot of it is just... Richard becoming something new, and gradually practicing the skill of accepting things as they happen in life. So there's partly a 'well who knows what's in Richard's future, maybe any of the above can still happen'. And there's definite hints that both Richard and Ben want to build on their relationship in the future, so we can hope that might happen for them. One thing I do really like is Richard's personal growth throughout the book.\n\nThis has already become a longer post than I intended, so I'm going to stop rambling. Just circling back to... something about the ending has just left me feeling at sea, a bit like Richard is at the end of the text. But instead of him feeling a sort of tranquil acceptance of whatever may come, I'm feeling dissatisfied with a seemingly abrupt running out, petering out, of words to a story I'd been otherwise really enjoying. It's left me not being able to put my finger on a rating for my Goodreads and my 2025 reading spreadsheet!\n\nAnyone else? Thoughts about this book?

A lot of the ones Robert comes across are zombie like with the traditional vampire limitations (sunlight, garlic, stakes, etc) so if he makes it back to his guarded home before night, he is relatively safe. The horror comes from seeing the world through the perspective of a hopeless man who is too miserable to want to keep living but too scared to die.\n\nRobert is a very miserable man and while I normally have no problem with unlikable main characters, I'll admit he had my eyes rolling so hard at first. Like seriously, the world has pretty much ended and his biggest grievance seems to be that he'll never have sex again. He thinks about sex a lot. I kind of just chalked it up to earlier sci fi male writers really over sexualizing women in their works but as I read on, yeah... never being able to receive affection (physically and emotionally) would be very bleak.\n\nI Am Legend was written over 60 years ago but the horror feels very modern, and not just because of Covid (though, the flash back to the very beginning of the outbreak felt very familiar). After a cataclysmic event, Robert is angry and depressed that his life has been taken away from him. His friends, coworkers, and neighbors are all enemies now. He can't trust anyone. He is paranoid, depressed, and scared. He is furious at how unfair his life is. He yearns for the past. He justifies his actions as necessary for survival. These are all feelings and emotions that feel very familiar because we've either felt them ourselves or because we see others going down that depressing path.\n\nSo, if you like psychological horror, >!unreliable narrators!<, and >!villain origin stories!<, I definitely recommend this book. If you like vampire stories... it read more like a zombie story than vampires for me, but I did really like how Matheson tried to explain the vampire lore and tropes with science.

Yet it's a YA fiction, and a very good one that smartly uses the colledge admission system as the biggest villain, which is super freshing in a way.\n\nThe protangonist, Mishca, is a working class high student who worked really hard in a private school (her mom got in debt to provide for her) yet she didn't receive any  admission letters. even her safety net failed her. With the help of her love interest and school supergirl (with computers) she managed to find that the headmaster of her school, in trying to make sure the kids of the biggest donors got accepted, intentionally screwed Mischa's recommendation letters and transcripts. Eventually she found out a way to blackmail the headmaster and make him get her a spot in some school yet Mishca decided to take a year's gap with her love interest.\n\nThere are definitely many cons: while the topic is relatable and down-to-earth, the characters sometimes talk like cartoon characters or Gossip Girls. I've never been to a private school so I don't know, but it's just so funny to imagine two high school rival girls clashing in the school corridor and trying to kill each other by staring lol\n\nAnd Mischa's superpower friend who hacked the school multiple times, needless to say, sounds too powerful while making the school seem too stupid ( I get that a lot of schools, even big-named ones can be useless and stupid in real life)\n\nOne debatable con for me is Mischa's motivation: when she got rejected she freaked out about not  going anywhere; she run away from her peers who got accpeted; she tried to hide it from her mother. It's very relatable but quite horrible when I realized among all those situations Mischa never talked about her could-be life in college or what she's gonna do with her career. For her, the admission means the-end. It really troubles me: I'd expect people to go to college to get a degree and then work in some field they are interested in. If Mischa's dilligence is purely based on peer pressure and trying to please her mom, then it's a horror story ineed.\n\nStill, the book is a fun read. It's obvious that the writer is quite experienced. Instead of making Mischa focusing on school alone, the writer managed to flesh out a bunch of important relationships with Mischa and some of them are quite resonating.\n\nMischa competed against with and hated since Day one, Meredith Dorsa, her peer. The two girls clashed several times in school yet eventually Meredith helped Mischa to expose the school master. I like the depiction of the relationship, reminds me of Mean Girls.\n\nMischa's mom, who got pregant in college spared no effort to provide for her reminds me of my mom. I know she loves me deeply, and would do anything for me, yet I don't like spending time with her. Too much stress, like I'm never good enough.

I think personally I have a bit of a pattern recognition thing where actually seeing names in front of me makes it far easier to ingrain the character into my memory bank for the future. Likewise with a movie/show when there are faces, it provides a visual input to contribute to the mental map, unlike audio.\n\n2. Ease of rereading passages/scenes. Sometimes it's nice to go back and make sure you caught something properly. For me personally, I'd have a much harder time justifying a rewind on an audio book because I'd feel too troubled to go through and hit rewind on whatever I'm using to listen. It may just be one extra step, or maybe it's three, but it would feel (to me) not worth the effort, and I'd just power through anyway.\n\n3. This one especially is a me thing, but visualization. Personally, if I want to take the time to truly visualize a setting or a character description, I don't mind taking a moment to do so. With standard reading, I can just pause whenever I want to do that, whereas with audio books I would need to hit a pause button. It sounds silly, but this absolutely would distract me far more than it's worth. It would make the audio experience feel far more clunky in comparison for me.\n\nI've rambled long enough. I'm especially interested in hearing from those of you who enjoy both audio books and standard reading! Can you tell in advance how conducive a book will be for one format vs the other? Are there any examples of books you actively disliked in one format, but really enjoyed in the other?", "date_utc": 1762201381.0, "title": "What do you think makes a book better or worse suited for audio formats compared to regular reading?

It feels like something a human cannot be capable of. It is somehow mercurially funny, deeply touching and ignominiously entertaining while also somehow balancing intellectual rigor with beautiful writing that stays immensely readable.\n\nSolenoid is about a man facing himself and feeling claustrophobically trapped by even the widest restraints of human existence. In a kind of internalized Dante's inferno, this unnamed narrator weaves a tale in his journal about the difficulties of a child suffering weak health and a healthy fear of dentistry, all the way up to present struggles as he spends his lonely midlife years teaching grade school in a fantastical Bucharest. From surreal, sentient machinery, to break room drama, to coworkers who bust their students' heads with rings the size of bowling balls, all the while, dusted with interesting and encyclopedic musings, the reader is constantly being entertained while shown the tight restraints of a human life. From a couple hundred pages onward, we are introduced to the picketists, a group of people who rebel against the injustices and anti-ethical principles of existence.\n\nAlong the way, we are whisked along a careening adventure: a search for the 5 Solenoids hidden around town which present a possible means of material escape from 3D matter as we know it. After a barrel of laughs, a pint of tears and a lifetimes worth of dream language communicated to the readers subconscious, one is left with an overall message of compassion very reminiscent of the bodhisattva vow of Mahayana Buddhism. The ending is a grand finale of a display and an emotional celebration of the dignity of life.\n\nEveryone must read Solenoid. \n\n5 \u2b50", "date_utc": 1762125124.0, "title": "[Book Review] It took me a few months after finishing it to really process it, but Solenoid by Mircea Cartarescu is my 2025 read of the year.", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "score": 77, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1omvx7h/book_review_it_took_me_a_few_months_after/"}, {"id": "1on24g4", "name": "t3_1on24g4", "content": "I really enjoyed this collection of short stories, all related to a devastating pandemic which emerges from the Arctic Ice at some point in the near future. \n\nIt was recommended previously in a thread about novels with interlinked tales, like Cloud Atlas or Cloud Cuckoo Land. \n\nThe novel starts strongly, with a teaser for the upcoming devastation, as well as introducing a few mysteries surrounding goings on around the Arctic Circle, and where and why the virus comes into being. \n\nThen the reader is sent into a complete tailspin, with a brutal chapter about a euthanasia theme park. On first look, there seems to be an element of dark satire brimming up, but in fact the chapter ends up being completely tragic. I think most would agree it is the high point of the book, and I think that the idea of Osiris and it's riders will stay with me and my thoughts for decades.\n\nTo be honest, after this point the book never really reaches those same heights, although there are excellent chapters about a psychic pig, Japanese capitalism/marketing in the face of mass deaths, and various other characters coming to terms with loss, funerals, what happens to their bodies after death and other themes, interspersed with ideas about how the near future could look after climate catastrophe and new tech/medicine etc becomes normalised.  \n\nI feel like fans of Black Mirror will enjoy this. However, this is not a book to open up if you're already feeling a bit down, as almost every chapter focuses on grief and death. In fact, it is probably a good idea to queue up some comedy, or a lighter read to open up later, to wash some of that mood away from your brain. \n\nA few things I found tricky to follow. One chapter focuses on a scientist attempting to harness Hawking Radiation to power interstellar flight, its quite short and refers often to a minitature black hole living in the protagonists head. This idea was really beyond me, I couldn't quite get it. \n\nAnother is about the introduction of 'elegy hotels', while it's clear these are used for the bereaved and bodies are sent there pre-funeral. I couldn't really figure out the real purpose of them, or what was actually going on there. One analysis I read described them as a adult version of the euthanasia theme park, for the dying to turn to for some last days of comfort before passing on. But the chapter seemed to imply the people in the hotels were already dead when their bodies arrived.\n\nI also am quite befuddled with the chapter set 'in the dark' with various apparent plague victims appearing to be disembodied, whilst memories of each of their lives play in the dark amongst floating orbs. At some stage they work together to push the body of a newborn child to the (seeming) top of the area they are trapped in. What do you guys think it actually happening here? Is it an afterlife? A simulation? Have their consciousness been uploaded to the cloud? (the last chapter references that humanity has achieved this in the far future). I thought perhaps that due to the plague their souls or DNA or otherwise have become partly of Clara's alien race, and their situation is somehow related to these creatures (especially due to the floating, glowing orbs) which seem to be a feature of the aliens true bodies.\n\nLastly, I would have loved to spent a bit more time with some of the characters, stories or themes. For instance, do other intelligent pigs emerge? I feel like there are also untold details about the 'City Of Laughter' were the people behind it actually altruistic? Or doing something more sinister behind the scenes (an interlude later mentions that the park gets shut down due to dodgy stem cell research going on there). What on earth happens to the people trapped in the dark, or the baby they attempt to send out of there?\n\nAnywhow, overall an excellent, and heavy read.", "date_utc": 1762142755.0, "title": "Just finished 'How High We Go In The Dark' - some thoughts, and queries", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "score": 21, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1on24g4/just_finished_how_high_we_go_in_the_dark_some/"}, {"id": "1omt0t4", "name": "t3_1omt0t4", "content": "I have gotten into reading non-fiction and although I normally stick to specific genres, I wanted to expand my reading habits and was thinking of looking at books that were shortlisted/longlisted for non-fiction literary prizes as starting points.\n\nI have looked at some books from the Baillee Gifford prize, such as 'Finest Hotel in Kabul', which has been a lovely read.

(It's in the public domain.) I like annotated editions of classics so I looked on Amazon and thought this edition would be great. I could not have been more wrong!\n\nNot only does Machado cook up her own fanfiction about the \"lost\" true story behind Carmilla and how le Fanu left out all the explicit sex that appeared in the \"original\" letters written by the \"real\" characters (all of this is made up), Machado also alters the actual text of the story! (Not to mention the additional personal fanfiction she weaves in through footnotes on minor characters' backgrounds and love life.) Machado dumbs down the text for readers, replacing lots of words and phrases, altering entire sentence structures and their meanings, etc. in every paragraph all throughout the book to \"modernize\" the text! It's so much worse than American editors changing some terms and punctuation in the *Harry Potter* books, for example. Machado gets away with these changes because the original work is in the public domain, but this is a sheer insult to the author and countless readers who just want to read the original. It's not even like le Fanu's language is archaic or old-fashioned like Shakespeare. I get the feeling that Machado's \"editing\" was nothing but an ego-boosting and attention-grabbing exercise on her part. If she truly wanted to make meaningful contributions, she could have produced an abridged version for young readers, a graphic novel, or something genuinely different, not just unnecessarily butchered the original language to leave her own mark while fooling people into buying the book thinking it's le Fanu's original text. (The cover should have said \"Adapted by CMM\" rather than \"Edited by CMM\".)\n\nHere are just a few spoiler-free examples of the innumerable alterations that Machado makes:\n\n* le Fanu's original: *In Styria, we, though by no means magnificent people, inhabit a castle, or schloss.*\u00a0\n   * Machado's edit: *In Styria, we -- though by no means magnificent people -- inhabit a* ***manor house***.\u00a0\n* le Fanu's original: *It was the figure of a hunchback, with the sharp lean features that generally accompany deformity. He wore a pointed black beard, and he was smiling from ear to ear, showing his white fangs. He was dressed in buff, black, and scarlet...*\n   * Machado's edit: ***He was a*** *hunchback, with sharp, lean features. He* ***had*** *a pointed black beard, and* ***he*** *was smiling from ear to ear, showing his white* ***teeth***. *He was dressed in* ***fawn***, *black, and scarlet...*\n* le Fanu's original: *I was relieved on hearing the voices of Carmilla and Madame, who were at that moment approaching. The voices died away.* *In this solitude, having just listened to so strange a story, connected, as it was, with the great and titled dead, whose monuments were moldering among the dust and ivy round us, and every incident of which bore so awfully upon my own mysterious case\u2014in this haunted spot, darkened by the towering foliage that rose on every side, dense and high above its noiseless walls\u2014a horror began to steal over me, and my heart sank as I thought that my friends were, after all, not about to enter and disturb this triste and ominous scene.*\n   * Machado's edit: ***Having just listened to so strange a story in this solitude*** *--connected, as it was, with the great and titled dead whose monuments* ***moldered*** *among the dust and ivy round us -- and* ***with every incident that matched*** *my own mysterious case*\u2014***a horror had begun to steal over me. I heard the voices of Carmilla and Madame, who were at that moment approaching.*** *In this haunted spot, darkened by the towering foliage that rose on every side, dense and high above its noiseless walls, my heart sank as I thought that my friends* ***were about to*** *enter and disturb this* ***sorrowful*** *and ominous scene.*\n\nIn the last example, note how Machado changes the sentence to mean the opposite of what it's supposed to! In the original, the narrator hears her friends and then thinks that they are not going to enter and break up the ominous scene (and make things happier). But Machado deletes the \"not\", so her sentence means the narrator actually doesn't want her friends to come and change the scene!\n\nSo if you're thinking of buying *Carmilla* for yourself or a friend and you value honesty and respect, avoid Machado at all costs. For a high-quality, properly edited and annotated edition, check out *Carmilla: A Critical Edition* edited by Kathleen Costello-Sullivan.

But reading Dante Inferno honestly changed that perspective for me. Dante\u2019s references blew my mind. He constantly mentions Greek philosophers, Christian theology and folklores. Dante\u2019s sense of geography is wild. He casually references places across Europe, North Africa, even parts of Asia, reading Inferno made me realize how wrong it is to picture medieval Europe as a place of total ignorance.

Then the book goes into how dual income families have made it harder for women to care for the elderly. I found this somewhat disturbing. Women don't cherish these roles but are expected into them without options. The truth is that there is no good solution. Majority of humans are scared to die and want to keep living even when it's hard to do so for them and for others. It's core instinct and cannot be overridden.

If you look in my comment history, you'll see some information about Hoopla and reasons why some libraries are cancelling their subscriptions.

Publishers, especially small publishers, don't always want to disclose this information. Librarians handle an incredible volume of ordering and do not have time to scrutinize every page of every book to look for AI-gen content.

So the premise of \"Once More Upon a Time\" immediately appealed to me.\n\nThe main characters are King Ambrose and Queen Imelda, and joining the cast of good guys is an enchanted cloak that thinks it is a horse.  The first part of the story is a play on the classic tale of \"The Twelve Dancing Princesses\", with Imelda being one of the lesser known princesses.  Imelda and Ambrose have just had a fairy tale wedding.  But when Imelda is in danger of being poisoned, Ambrose accepts a deal from a witch: in exchange for her life, he must forget his love for her.  Due to the terms of \"Love's Keep\" where they live, the entire kingdom is now at stake, and for one year they're resigned to living a loveless marriage.  But can their love be rekindled?\n\nUnfortunately the execution doesn't live up to the intriguing concept.  For a relatively short work where the plot should be crystal clear, things get surprisingly confusing about the exact terms of the deal, and who is forgetting what, and why, and for how long.  The style also disappoints.  I've read part of Chokshi's popular Pandava Quintet, which was marred by trying too hard to be relevant to today's pop culture and at times used cheesy language.  Similar flaws were evident in this work, and \"Once More Upon a Time\" gets incredibly cringeworthy at times.  It's not helped by several instances of sexual innuendo and mature content that definitely put this outside the YA market and into adult territory.\n\nWhat could have been an unique and engaging romantic fairy tale just fell very flat, and felt more confused than charmed.

I found it to be more of a sequel to that favoured and long ago discovered, by me at least, book Deadhouse Gates, which, in part, tells the story of The Chain of Dogs, than a few other books in The Malazan Book of the Fallen series. As such, it has me pondering on the other books in the series, in particular Deadhouse Gates and the other Malazan books set on the same continent, and talking the ears off any friend foolishly enough to entertain my enthusiasm.\n\nUnfortunately I have no friends who have read the books, so the reasons for my unbridled enthusiasm requires explanation. One friend, when describing to them the importance of The Chain of Dogs plot line, to the series as well as the fans, remarked that they had never heard of a book that involved a, so called by its fans, rite of passage. To my surprise, I couldn\u2019t think of another example either.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know about the Malazan epic fantasy book series, it is seen as quite the experience to actual read a specific plot line in the second book Deadhouse Gates and is known amongst fans as walking The Chain of Dogs. There are a few reasons as why it is considered to be of such import to fans of the series. For many it is the point when they finally fall in love with the books and/or finally understand what Erikson is going for in terms of the sheer scope of the story and themes. Another is that, whilst considered utterly brilliant by its fans, especially the ending, it is often seen as quite the ordeal to actually read, being that the story and way it is written can be harrowing to experience. It would take a heart of stone (or simply one not gelling with the book) to not be affected by it. I, whilst admit to being someone apt to being emotionally affected by books, I was left stunned after finishing Deadhouse Gates in a way unlike any other experience I have had.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve explained what The Chain of Dogs is, although my wish not to spoil maybe has left my explanation a little vague, can anyone think of another book series with a book, plot line or just a moment that would considered a rite of passage like walking The Chain of Dogs is seen to Malazan fans?\n\n\n\n\n", "date_utc": 1761760446.0, "title": "Fans of Malazan Book of the Fallen have a rite of passage known to them as walking The Chain of Dogs, achieved by finishing the second book in the series.

I listened to the audiobook, which the author reads herself (not the worst reader I've ever listened to but it's good that she has a successful day job). The book was published in September of 2025.\n\nTo start, although the title (in full, The Arrogant Ape: The Myth of Human Exceptionalism and Why It Matters) is a semi-accurate description of the book's theme--namely, scientists err when they assess the intelligence of non-humans in anthropocentric terms and find it wanting by comparison--I think it does the book a slight disservice by not adequately expressing how much of the discussion regards non-human life. The book engages in a fair amount of, in my opinion, deserved bashing of the European scientific and philosophical traditions that promote human intellectual exceptionalism, but it does this with a wide-ranging exploration of examples of non-human intelligence that is quite rewarding to read.\n\nIf you already have an interest in the minds of animals, some of the examples of non-human intelligence will likely be familiar to you. What makes the book worthwhile is how she uses these examples to show how time and again, going back to the Greeks, western thinkers have erred in their assessment of the inner lives of non-humans because of the conviction that humans are obviously superior. \n\nBeing a primatologist, the author starts off showing how we err in assessing primate intelligence by, among other things, testing them at activities that they would never encounter in the wild, like at computer tablet activities; or testing them in environments that are likely to hinder their success, like isolated in laboratory cages instead of in natural environments with fellow members of their own species.\n\nFrom there, the book expands to other mammals, and then birds and fish, crustaceans and insects, plants and slime molds. Along the way she discusses primate-centrism and neuro-centrism. She also shows the interplay between all these ideas and those of racism and colonialism. Eventually she dabbles a little in panpsychism, Native American religious attitudes to non-human life, and Gaia theory. \n\nThe end goal is to show how the dominant paradigms regarding non-human minds do a disservice not only to non-human life but to us as well (full disclosure: I am a human), and are at the root of the ecological crises of our times.\n\nThe scientific and philosophical level of discussion is geared toward all readers. \n\nTrigger Warning: Those of you who hate \"woke\" might have an aneurysm while reading this.\n\nI enjoyed the book because I love animals, have an interest in the philosophy of mind, and think we need a major course correction in our relationship with the natural world. I, personally, didn't learn a ton I didn't already know (Edit: I'm old and have read a fair number of books about this subject, others might learn a lot) but it was a good recap and it helped me put together my various thoughts about these subjects into a cohesive philosophy.", "date_utc": 1761766128.0, "title": "A short review of The Arrogant Ape, a popular science book about non-human minds", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "score": 58, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1oje387/a_short_review_of_the_arrogant_ape_a_popular/"}, {"id": "1oj6mzz", "name": "t3_1oj6mzz", "content": "From the article:\n\n>Award winning inclusive children\u2019s publisher Knights Of is to close, *The Bookseller* understands, with accountancy firm Hart Shaw instructed to place the company in liquidation, pending a vote of the shareholders.\n\n>The company \u2013 which as of 16th October ceased trading \u2013 is expected to go into\u00a0liquidation during the week of 10th November.\u00a0Shareholders include co-founder and MD Aim\u00e9e Felone, co-founder Dee Stevens, and authors Robin Stevens and Sophie Anderson.\n\n>No reason has been given for the collapse, though it is understood that KO had been talking to publishers about a potential sale for sometime.

At the time, Felone said: \u201cKnights Of was born out of a frustration with the lack of representative voices and narratives in children\u2019s fiction.

I\u2019m a sucker for noir and these are easily some of the best in any medium. This post may be a bit lengthy but I\u2019d really like to hear people\u2019s thoughts.\n\nThe formula is consistent and good. One or more psychosexually twisted policemen investigate a sprawling case that they gradually get sucked into, barraged at all times with tiny pieces of information that all somehow come together into a neat package at the end. The surprising thing is it hits every time. The prose beams directly into your head just on account of its perfect rhythm and the plots somehow stay consistently bleak while always having at least one hell yeah moment per book. The real clincher for me is it\u2019s perfectly in tune with how pathetic and strange people can be.\n\nThe Black Dahlia is probably the one least subject to total Ellroy overload and has the best main character of all of them, if only because he\u2019s just mundane enough that his angst feels real. It has the most non-case related intrigue which helps flesh out the characters and the coolest psychosexual drama of them all in the weird Challenger\u2019s esque love triangle between the main characters. It has a few too many final revelations for my taste though.\n\nThe Big Nowhere is easily the best of them all. All of the characters and plots fit in perfectly and come together at the end in a way that got to me to finish the last half in one night. Upshaw and Meeks were particular standouts, with the former\u2019s story being shockingly empathetic given the usual lurid depiction of homosexuality. The ending was the highlight, especially the torching of the communist investigation. It also has the benefit of introducing Dudley Smith, one the best villains in any book I\u2019ve read, mostly because he\u2019s just sort of a dragon, an avatar of pure malice. \n\nLA Confidential is quite good but surprisingly my least favorite. The conspiracy is too complicated, has a lot of superfluous hangnails, and is bogged down by somehow involving two different serial killers and Dudley\u2019s plan to silence witnesses involving staging the biggest prison break in LA history. All the Dieterling stuff seemed promising but fizzled out strangely, with the coup being the strange reveal that Exley\u2019s pseudo-uncle was responsible for unrelated murders. Positives are that Exley and White are in the top protagonists of the Quartet and their hatred feels relatable from both ends. Inez is the best love interest in the Quartet, despite the bizarre ending with her suicide pact with her boss and ex\u2019s dad. The ending was also both bleak and great, and cements Exley as probably second best protagonist.\n\nWhite Jazz is probably the tightest and most technically proficient of the books and helped by the fact that it has only one protagonist. It\u2019s also great in that it has the single least redeemable protagonist of any of them in Dave Klein, and the book mostly just follows his downward trajectory. The conspiracy is fairly tight and it gives a great resolution to the overarching Dudley Smith plot of the books, as well as giving you a look at a more grizzled Exley. The romance is a real stinker though, and almost makes you wish that Klein\u2019s sister was the main love interest, which felt somewhat superfluous to have in the first place. Has a similar problem to the Black Dahlia in having too many endings. The old man reprieve at the end is a bit too much. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "date_utc": 1761709758.0, "title": "Finally finished the LA Quartet and needed to unload", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "score": 22, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1oiukq9/finally_finished_the_la_quartet_and_needed_to/"}, {"id": "1oibjv4", "name": "t3_1oibjv4", "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nWhat are you reading?

Because the first book *Annihilation* is written in such a way that is far more likely to reel in the attention of the more \"average\" reader. And I don't mean \"average\" in skill level or anything like that, I mean \"average\" in terms of preferences for balance of plot/characterization/worldbuilding/descriptiveness/etc. The biologist as a protagonist is a phenomenal blend of intuitive and curious, but develops more shades of unreliable narrator as the story progresses until you genuinely cannot tell if she's fully lost it by the end, or if she's as sane as she's ever been. The tower is such a uniquely unsettling and uncomfortable setting, and VanderMeer's ability to draw curiosity into such a nightmare is exceptional.\n\nThe second book *Authority* takes a sharp turn of nearly 180 degrees. It deviates from the intensely psychological, heart-pounding environmental horror of *Annihilation*, and instead goes the direction of something far more mundane and (mostly) real-life. It becomes this deeply cerebral character study of the protagonist John/Control as he navigates the world of being planted as the new director of the Southern Reach, parsing through the various breadcrumbs left behind by the previous director, familiarizing himself with the \"biologist\" who mysteriously returned from her expedition and the rest of the Southern Reach's staff and what is known about Area X, and battling with his own sense of free will, morality, and reality. \n\nThis book is *dramatically* different from *Annihilation*, and I can 100% understand why a chunk of people who loved *Annihilation* would be thoroughly put off by *Authority*. The progression of plot feels stagnant, and for plot-driven readers, I totally see that being valid reason to hit the eject button. But the deep dive into the character of John/Control, and his developing sense of both knowledge and raw paranoia, was *exquisitely* done for my personal tastes. I love a plot-driven narrative too, but VanderMeer's ability to insert that alien-like discomfort of Area X into a person's mind while navigating the largely mundane \"regular\" world elicited this brilliant slow-creeping agony of need to know what comes next. Plus I think the ending of this book with him and Ghost Bird diving into what they can only assume is Area X from a completely different entry point was the perfect cliffhanger going into the final book.\n\n*Acceptance* takes bits and pieces of *Annihilation* and *Authority* and mashes them into one, taking on a story arc that feels both a fusion and a completely new style at the same time. I loved the structure of the book, told from four different perspectives, two of which in the \"present\" (Ghost Bird and John/Control) as well as two in the past (The Director/Cynthia/Gloria and The Lighthouse Keeper/Saul). It felt very similar to a David Mitchell novel, where the various converging storylines all started coming together into one explosive \"resolution\" that required each character's perspective to fully capture the emotional toll of the trilogy as a whole. \n\nSaul's slow descent into madness(?) and his unconscious role in the creation and expansion of Area X, The Director's backstory and her tie to the geographical area that used to be where Area X is now (also, her perspective told from second person POV was a WILD choice, which I took to more or less mean she was the primary protagonist of this book), John's/Control's unraveling into the brightness initially experienced/described by the biologist in book one as he yearns for independence, and Ghost Bird's quest for identity and understanding. It was this beautiful converging tale that answered so many questions, while simultaneously answering almost *zero* of the core questions behind Area X itself.\n\nOnce again, I can see how that last sentence would be a major ick for some readers, and that's perfectly logical. Some readers hope for legitimate answers and want to have a feeling of closure at the end of a story. But I think the open-ended nature of the conclusion of this trilogy perfectly captured the general WTF-ery of Area X at its heart. We learned so much and simultaneously so little, leaving this feeling of empty satisfaction that embodies the pristine alien fortitude of Area X. It can't be understood with words, only by assimilating to Area X do you gain its true understanding, at which point you can no longer be considered human nor part of the human world as it is known and understood.\n\nGhost Bird is the only character left alive (that we know of) who is capable of being content with both Area X and the mundane human world, as the direct manifestation of both of those worlds. I'm simply awestruck.\n\nIt was interesting to see the further development of Lowry's character, of Jack and Jackie Severance's characters (and their influence over the potentially-unintentional creation of Area X through their connection to the S&SB), and seeing the origin of the writings on the wall of the tower. But seeing the origin did nothing in the way of providing an *explanation* for it.\n\nI do have this gnawing desire for more concrete answers to things not fully addressed by the trilogy, some of which I hope are answered in *Absolution*, but all of which I've already resigned to not knowing. Not knowing is the core of this entire series. It's incredibly frustrating, but that's exactly the point. It's supposed to be frustrating. It's supposed to gradually eat away at you until all that you can possibly do is succumb to it.\n\nThe Southern Reach trilogy went positively everywhere and nowhere at entirely separate and converging intervals. It was a fever dream of madness and beauty, I'll be thinking about it for a long time, and I'm positive it will earn numerous rereads over the years.", "date_utc": 1761580557.0, "title": "Blown away by Jeff VanderMeer's Southern Reach trilogy (light spoilers)", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "score": 88, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ohi7uf/blown_away_by_jeff_vandermeers_southern_reach/"}, {"id": "1ohfbp2", "name": "t3_1ohfbp2", "content": "This was a very easy read. It almost felt like a throwback to the kind of thrillers I used to read when I was younger. Dan Brown or Dean Koontz vibes. As if one of those authors was tasked with explaining the \"multiverse\" concept to an audience less familiar with sci-fi or superhero tropes.\n\nSo much of the novel feels dated in that way. Crouch's male gaze festers throughout the whole thing - the way he'll often describe female characters as \"a blonde\" or \"a redhead\" etc. felt really uncomfortable to me.   \n  \nIt also feels like it takes the protagonist a long time to catch up with the premise of the book readers are already familiar with before they begin reading. By the time he's come to terms with what's happening to him, you're halfway through it.\n\nI do want to give credit to the turn things take in the finale though (spoiler warning), with multiple instances of the protagonist returning to \"his\" world. That really complicated things and muddied the ethical waters in an interesting way. It's a shame the finale ultimately breaks down into violence, though. It feels like a more inspired solution was sitting right there - Jason should've brought his family into the box in order to create additional instances of them, who could then unite with his branched selves, and multiple versions of the family could have their own unique happy endings. It's still possible something like that happens after the events of the novel, but the text itself doesn't really allude to the idea. As it stands, the ending ends up feeling bittersweet and somewhat unresolved.\n\nA nice breezy read, especially as a palette cleanser between other books, but ironically enough, a better version of this story could've been told.", "date_utc": 1761573958.0, "title": "Dark Matter by Blake Crouch - Thoughts After Reading", "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "score": 100, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ohfbp2/dark_matter_by_blake_crouch_thoughts_after_reading/"}, {"id": "1ohimxx", "name": "t3_1ohimxx", "content": "Just finished reading *Lost Gods* (2016) by *Brom*, a book that reminds you why \u201cdark fantasy\u201d exists as a genre. Its a vivid, unsettling and surprisingly emotional story that drives a hook in your chest and drags you through the underworld, while somehow making you care about every grimy, grotesque detail that hits you along the way.\n\nBrom\u2019s background as an artist is evident every page. His worlds aren't just described; they are painted in the mind full of broken gods, forsaken cities and landscapes that feel alive. The included illustrations only deepen that immersion, giving the whole book a tactile, visual power that\u2019s rare in modern fantasy.\n\nThe plot follows a young man\u2019s desperate journey through purgatory to save his wife and unborn child, a straightforward quest, intricately woven with rich mythology and profound moral tension. The line between horror and beauty blurs so completely that one often becomes the other, punctuated by Brom striking a haunting emotional note that lingers well after a chapter ends.\n\nThe book has a great, eventful, fast-paced first and third act which might make the slightly slow middle feel out of place in comparison, but thats just nitpicking a novel this visually and thematically ambitious. To convey the experience in terms of cinema, imagine Pan\u2019s Labyrinth\u2019s tragic poetry, Constantine\u2019s hellish grit, What Dreams May Come\u2019s emotional quest and Hellblazer's nonchalance all fused together.\u00a0\n\nPick it up if you\u2019re in the mood for a fantasy that\u2019s equal parts brutal and beautiful, with world-building so vivid it feels like a descent into a realm suspended between myth and memory.\n\n8/10", "date_utc": 1761581480.0, "title": "Lost Gods by Brom, a review.", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "score": 39, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ohimxx/lost_gods_by_brom_a_review/"}, {"id": "1ohbpbv", "name": "t3_1ohbpbv", "content": "**A terrific fictionalised version of the Batavia disaster**\n\nThe original version of this debut novel ***Daughters of Batavia*** by Stefanie Koens won the 2023 Banjo Prize, an annual competition for Australian writers, and subsequently went on to be published by HarperCollins.  It can be loosely categorized as historical fiction, because it recounts the infamous story of the wreck of the ship Batavia in the Abrolhos Islands off the coast of Western Australia in 1628, and the horrors that followed for those who survived.\n\nThe main story revolves around Saskia, one of the passengers aboard the Batavia.  The events of the 17th century are recounted via a clever framing device which tells the story of Tess, a young woman in the modern day who is searching for answers about her own life and about her connection to the Batavia.  The narrative flips between these two stories, with the shipwreck itself occurring about halfway the book.  What happened afterwards was horrific, with the survivors having to face murder, massacre, and even violent abuse and rape at the hands of a number of power-drunk leaders and psychopaths.\n\nThe twin stories dovetail together nicely, and the blending of fiction with history is expertly done.  It is evident that the author has researched the Batavia story very well, and the resulting story is plausible and quite true to history, while also being an engaging and suspenseful read.  The novel also incorporates up-to-date archaeological research on the Abrolhos Islands by a team of researchers from the University of Western Australia, so it also feels current.\n\nThere are definite adult themes, such as instances of abusive treatment and men forcing themselves on women, but this simply reflects the historical record.  I was pleased to see these incidents handled sensitively and discretely, rather than gratuitously. For instance, there's reference to \"the searching hands\" of Saskia's uncle, mention men \"servicing\" women, or phrasing like this: \"You know little of men\u2019s twisted desires\" (p.334).  While this is true to life and to history, this kind of content does make the book a work of adult fiction, and I wouldn't suggest it for older children.\n\nFrom some of my wider reading, I later learned that the publication of an account of the catastrophic voyage of the Batavia in the mid 1640s led the directors of the Dutch East India Company to limit the number of female passengers sailing on company ships going forwards.  They considered the Batavia catastrophe a prime example of how the presence of women was considered to disrupt relations of those in board.  This novel certainly shows how that can happen.\n\nThere are also faith elements incorporated into the storyline, mostly as a result of the religious convictions of the characters.  Not until reading this book did I realize that the passengers aboard the Batavia included a Calvinist minister, and the way the author incorporated this naturally into the storyline was also handled well, including numerous Scripture quotations.  I wouldn't consider this Christian fiction, and yet it does have solid content that reflects the religious convictions that many of the passengers would have had, and articulates their sentiments.\n\nFrom a literary point of view, the novel is also well-constructed.  Besides the interplay of two stories, modern and historical, the author demonstrates a real skill with words, and this is especially evident in the use of her imagery, such as metaphors and similes.  I found just one aspect somewhat implausible, namely when a 17 year old girl gets away with being disguised as a boy simply by cutting her hair; but maybe that is viable, and it wasn't hard to suspend my sense of disbelief in reading that section.\n\nDespite the violence and horror experienced by many survivors following the shipwreck of the Batavia, this is not just a pessimistic book about tragedy.  For instance, at the end we learn something very satisfying about one character that really rounds off a subplot beautifully.  The story of modern-day Tess is also one of discovery and personal growth, as she learns to face the demons and hurts of her own past.\n\nRomantic overtones feature quite strongly and regularly throughout the book, both in the contemporary story of Tess and in the historical story of the 17th century characters.  I suspect that this factor makes the book appeal especially to women readers, and the high proportion of reviews from females seems to support that.  The fact that the story is largely told through female eyes means it will especially resonate emotionally with women.\n\nBut this is a fine novel that should appeal to anyone interested in the history around the Batavia, or simply looking for a gripping and well-told story. Stefanie Koens has produced an excellent book that links stories past and present, history and fiction.  In the process she not only bring the past to life, but infuses it with imagination and emotion, creating a bridge to today's reader that is simultaneously informative, inspiring, and evocative.", "date_utc": 1761563980.0, "title": "\"Daughters of Batavia\" by Stefanie Koens - my thoughts", "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "score": 17, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ohbpbv/daughters_of_batavia_by_stefanie_koens_my_thoughts/"}, {"id": "1ohacq5", "name": "t3_1ohacq5", "content": "Hello readers!\n\nEvery Monday, we will post a calendar with the date and topic of that week's threads and we will update it to include links as those threads go live.

Has anyone here finished the nearly 1,000-page nightmare novel? Or am I alone in my suffering?\n\nThe book is relentless, full of war crimes, genocide, mass shootings, pogroms, sexual violence, starvation, >!sexual assault, incest,!<etc. Man's inhumanity to man during WWII? Name your war crime, this book probably has it.\n\nI\u2019ve read a lot of challenging history books,  mostly about WWII and genocide, but also about colonialism. *King Leopold\u2019s Ghost* and *Late Victorian Holocausts* come to mind. Then the heavy hitters: *Auschwitz: A Doctor\u2019s Eyewitness Account*, *Bloodlands: Between Stalin and Hitler*, *Ordinary Men*, *Anatomy of a Genocide*, *Auschwitz: A New History*, *Flyboys*, *The Drowned and the Saved*, *The Origins of Totalitarianism*, and others. I\u2019m usually pretty difficult to upset. I spent years reading disturbing texts for school\n\nMy capstone project for my history degree was about lynching as a spectacle and how white American media\u2019s portrayal of it evolved from the 19th to the early 20th century. I read accounts of every imaginable act of racial hatred carried out in front of an audience: immolation, mutilation, castration, strangulation, and more.\n\nI'm used to a certain academic distance that allows me to get through these texts without being upset or emotional.\n\nBut *The Kindly Ones*\u2026 where do I even begin? As a fictional account of an unrepentant SD officer involved with the *Einsatzgruppen* >!(and disturbingly sexually obsessed with his twin sister)!<, it\u2019s one of the most harrowing reading experiences I\u2019ve ever had. Maximilien Aue got under my skin in a way few characters ever have. I feel a little dirty even trying to *describe* this book.\n\nI don\u2019t really know how to describe it beyond the surface; I just know I felt a little haunted after finishing it. Aue is the most interesting, but also the most foul example of humanity I've read in any book. He is an unreliable narrator incarnate.\n\nThe novel is truly a Greek tragedy in a Nazi uniform. I entered the story interested in how someone could choose to engage in war crimes for the state. I left the book thinking about how a man could >!rationalize incest and be so completely in denial about brutally killing his French mother and stepfather... to avenge a deadbeat German father who abandoned him... his reason for wearing the black uniform to!< make himself into a Greek hero, a perpetual victim of fate.>! If only the furies were real and would catch up with him. Of failing that, Mossad.!<\n\nHas anyone else read it? Did it get under your skin, too? Or am I alone?\n\nEdit: I think part of the backlash against this book in the U.S. came from readers expecting a Holocaust novel, when *The Kindly Ones* really isn\u2019t one. It\u2019s a Greek tragedy wearing historical clothes, more about moral collapse than historical witness. It's also unapologetically graphic and full of European references to art, music, philosophy, and other niche topics that most readers might not have much exposure to. By the last third of the novel, it\u2019s not even about WWII anymore. It\u2019s about the failure of intellect and meaning itself. >!And the book offers no catharsis. Aue will die haunted, lonely, and free, like most war criminals did. !<American audiences, in general, don\u2019t have much patience for ambiguity.\n\n", "date_utc": 1761358680.0, "title": "Hardest Fictional Novel - The Kindly Ones", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "score": 116, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ofg2wm/hardest_fictional_novel_the_kindly_ones/"}, {"id": "1ogtzv4", "name": "t3_1ogtzv4", "content": "I first thought about banning *Clarissa or The History of A Young Lady*, and I toyed with idea of banning *Lolita*, because I am so done with hearing completely wild and insane opinions about it, and about Nabakov. *Grapes of Wrath* was up there too.

To my surprise, many people spoke about Heathcliff with deep compassion, even admiration. Some described him as tragic, romantic, and apparently found him attractive.\n\nI sat there feeling nothing but revulsion.\n\nTo me, Heathcliff isn\u2019t a romantic hero. He\u2019s a sadist, an abuser, a man consumed by vengeance and cruelty and just violence. I couldn\u2019t understand how anyone could speak about him so positively.\n\nYes, I understand why Heathcliff is the way he is. Or I think I do. He been through a lot of rejection, humiliation, and psychological and physical trauma of getting beat up. He was orphaned and denied love. But does that justify his actions? No.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to explain a person\u2019s behavior; it\u2019s another to excuse it. Heathcliff doesn\u2019t just suffer, he causes a lot of suffering. He endured cruelty but he is just as cruel to others.  That\u2019s not tragic romance to me, that's the cycle of abuse repeating itself.\n\nI kept wanting to ask people in the club if this were real life, would you still defend him? If Heathcliff had abused YOU, imprisoned you, manipulated or tormented your kids, would you pity him? But Emily Bront\u00eb writes it and we call it gothic passion and love and somehow its' okay?\n\nAnd yet\u2026 part of me wonders if I\u2019m missing something. Clearly, other readers see a complexity in Heathcliff that I can\u2019t. Maybe they see his pain as proof of his humanity? Maybe they admire his raw passion or the power of his \"love\" or some sort of innocence or honesty or rebellion against social or moral convention?\n\nI can admit that on a literary level, Heathcliff is fascinating and not your boring one dimensional villain but I kind of have a bad reaction to him as if I imagine him as a real person. I just can't buy the package of passion and obsession and cruelty together as one being labeled love.\n\nSomebody in the club was saying Heathcliff loved too much. I think he destroyed too much. I got nothing against someone loving too much.\n\nSo, to anyone who truly sees something positive (what's the word, redeemable?) in Heathcliff, please help me understand what you see that I can\u2019t?", "date_utc": 1761278851.0, "title": "I just can't have a positive view of Heathcliff.

The cure does not grant immortality, people can still die from terminal illnesses if they contract them, or by means of physical harm/violence which would kill anybody, but the cure does stop the aging process. So if you get the cure at age 25, you will live the rest of your life looking the same as you did at 25 with none of the visual signs of aging or associated musculoskeletal degradation. None of this is a meaningful spoiler, it's all clearly laid out very early in the book.\n\n**The Format**\n\nFor me, the format is actually one of the most interesting parts of the book. It's told in a series of various journal entries, emails, news transcriptions, headlines, and probably several other forms I'm not recalling immediately off the top of my head. I think Magary's experience as a journalist comes through for him in spades with this format. For me personally, it never felt convoluted, and it served as a very interesting means of worldbuilding that didn't require nearly as many deep dives into various scenes across chapters and time. It felt like he was able to paint a very adequate picture of the world as he went along, which was evident in the behavior of his protagonist as well.\n\n**The Protagonist**\n\nThe main character John is decidedly unlikeable, and definitely done on purpose. At the beginning of the book, we meet him as a mortal 29 year old lawyer who has yet to receive the cure. What's frustrating is that he's often unlikeable in a highly relatable way. His poor decisions (and his good ones) throughout the book are incredibly human, and the degree to which I could envision myself making a lot of similar decisions if I were placed in his shoes is rather unsettling. \n\n**The Conflicts**\n\nI'll fully admit that there are still parts of this book that I wish got better explanations. I won't be any more specific than that, because I don't want to drop any hints about what potential readers may or may not find out as they go along. But I will say that the general goings-on in the world (and mostly focused on the US, where the book takes place) where the opportunity to cure aging is thrust upon a capitalist society feels disturbingly realistic and in-tune. From the corporate side to the spiritual/religious side to the parasocial/societal side to the legal side, it all feels completely plausible, and that did not feel good (nor is it supposed to).\n\n**The Writing**\n\nThe format of this book being what it is, in my opinion, allows for a bit of leniency when evaluating this book from a technical writing perspective. It's far from perfect, there are times where the prose feels a bit too purple for the context/tone, but overall I think Magary did a pretty solid job with the balance of tone, descriptiveness, and situationally appropriate and relatable dialog. I could probably have done with a bit less simile, but aside from that I don't have a lot to complain about. \n\nI'll also acknowledge that there are some thematic elements which may or may not be realistic for people who work professionally in certain fields. As somebody who does not specialize in any of those fields, I cannot in good conscience speak to their accuracy, and all I can say is that it sounded legit from a layperson's POV. But that's the risk with sci-fi/spec fic, you can't please everybody!\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nI've seen some comments from people who didn't like the ending of this book, but for me personally, I mostly disagree. I think the ending is actually very apt, both story-wise and character-wise. The only thing I wish I got from the ending was more of the above-mentioned conflict explanation. In terms of how Magary chose to finish the book, from a plot arc perspective though, I think he nailed it. The protagonist was given a legitimately complex balance of situational character development *and* self-induced stubborn developmental stunting (if that makes sense) that felt authentically human.\n\nThis was a really fascinating read that I'd absolutely recommend to anybody looking for a (from my perspective) unique dystopian tale. It gets an 8.5/10 for me, and I'm sure will earn a reread at some point later down the line after it has had some time to simmer.", "date_utc": 1761145061.0, "title": "The Postmortal by Drew Magary - Utopian Invention, Dystopian Reality (No Spoilers)", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "score": 76, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1odal29/the_postmortal_by_drew_magary_utopian_invention/"}, {"id": "1ocmtjn", "name": "t3_1ocmtjn", "content": "", "date_utc": 1761075717.0, "title": "Boris Johnson admits writing books using ChatGPT", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "score": 2029, "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-boris-johnson-admits-writing-books-using-chatgpt-ai/"}, {"id": "1od6axs", "name": "t3_1od6axs", "content": "Svaagat mate,\n\nDiwali started on October 20 and to celebrate, we are discussing Indian literature.

Even as someone who defends how he writes sex and women it's still not perfect for me either and I can see what the flaws are that people refer to.\n\nNorwegian Wood had so much controversy around it that I was expecting it to be so much worse than it actually was. Murakami is consistently a supremely horny author, so I was surprised when a book criticized for writing all the women as sex objects was significantly less horny and problematic than \"The Wind Up Bird Chronicle.\" There was a lot of sex in the novel, but it was never treated as sex in and of itself, and the female characters were never treated only as sex objects.\n\nWhat I think is interesting mostly is two points of criticism:\n\n1) \"The female side characters are not fleshed out and come off as shallow\"\n\nand \n\n2) \"The female characters are poorly written vis a vis sex and the novel as a whole sexually objectifies women.\"\n\nI don't think wither of these are true at all, but what's interesting for me about the first point is that I really don't see how it matters either way. Norwegian Wood is very clearly the exploration of one confused, depressed, and disaffected young man trying to grow up and learn who he is in a specific place and time. The novel is marketed as a love story, and it is, but it's mostly a coming of age story. I don't see why the side characters need to be fleshed out and I have no issue with the side characters being used as mirrors for Toru's own personal growth. Of course the side characters, and the women, all revolve around Toru, he is the center of the story, he's the protagonist of the book, things happen to him.\n\nAnd that aside, I didn't find that Midori/Naoko/Reiko were egregiously shallow (Reiko is on thin ice though for real). Naoko certainly comes off as shallow and uninteresting, but that's completely intentional I think. This leads me to another point that I've never seen anyone bring up in regards to this novel, which is that **Toru is an unreliable narrator.** Toru consistently over romanticizes things, understates his feelings, and lies about how much he hurts/cares to himself and to the reader. Naoko isn't shallow, she's emotionally distant and disturbed and Toru is obsessed with her. We learn so little about her because Toru genuinely knows so little about her and yet cares enormously anyways. It's stupid and irrational but it makes sense because he's a kid and he'll figure it out. Midori is criticized for being a typical \"pixie manic dream girl\" (also like Naoko? This comparison has always been insane to me; Naoko is not a MPDG). And while I can completely see how Midori is exactly that, I don't think it's a problem for the book or character. I think that this criticism, like many criticisms of this novel, are moreso meta-critiques of Murakami the man and his overall body of work rather than this one novel itself. Midori is certainly a repetitive character if you've read May Kasahara or any of the other similar women Murakami has written in his other works, but looking at NW in isolation she's very unique. Especially considering that her whole character seems to be pushing against norms around women of a certain class. I don't know anything about Japanese culture in the 1960s, but I know that generally Japan is regarded as being restrictive and sexually regressive, so if there was any sort of 60s counter culture movement in the East then it's easy to follow how a person like Midori would have actually been super subversive, especially in comparison to the all the \"normal\" girls that Toru bounces off of, like Hatsumi's friends. \n\nFor the second point: **\"The female characters are poorly written vis a vis sex and the novel as a whole sexually objectifies women.\"** \n\nThis criticism is kind of bizarre to me in the context of the book. The whole book directly goes against sexualization in favor of genuine romantic relationships, everything Toru does with Nagasawa is meant to be disgusting and immoral and it directly contrasts with the purity of his experience visiting Naoko. When Toru has mindless sex with drunk girls he isn't thinking of their bodies or their sex- he's thinking about how gross he feels. Compare this to how he describes Naoko's naked body in such a heavenly manner and it's like night and day. This isn't even subtext, Reiko, Hatsumi, and Toru himself all say similar things outright. \n\nThe next thought I had is that I feel like this criticism itself is actually pretty misogynistic. How come writing sexually active women who have one night stands and want to explore their sexuality is a bad thing but writing similar male characters is no problem? Why isn't Nagasawa criticized as much, or Toru himself?  I think a lot of people put so much emphasis on sex, and put female sexuality especially, on such a pedestal that any treatment of it feels wrong. To me this comes across as more of a personal issue than one with the book. Sex is an important part of our lives, especially for coming of age, so to write characters in this age cohort that fuck like rabbits doesn't come off as unrealistic or as sexualizing at all to me. Sex is worth writing about, but simultaneously it isn't sacred. When we criticize how Murakami wrote Naoko/Midori vis a vis sex then it's kinda like saying that that is the most important thing about them when it isn't, and it treats female sexuality as something to be policed which historically it has been.\n\nThis idea is also so weird to me because it is so clear in the Novel that Toru is haunted by and focused on not his sexual relationship with Naoko/Midori, but by his emotional connection to them. He is obsessed with Naoko because he feels obligation to her and because on some level he associates leaving her with leaving Kizuki. Simultaneously he understates his feelings for Midori because he is afraid of opening up and being emotionally close with someone again.\n\nThe book has a lot of sex in it, but the sex itself is always treated as vaguely unsatisfying and unimportant compared to genuine intimacy. The female characters have a lot of sex, and are talked about in sexual terms frequently, but what is prioritized as Toru grows up is any chance at real love. \n\nAgain, none of this is subtext, if anything Murakami is awkwardly un-subtle with how he uses Reiko to explain the themes of the story to the reader. I genuinely don't understand where or how people are complaining about how the women were written related to sex when the themes of the novel make it clear that when Toru does sexualize women it was wrong and that true intimacy is more valuable. And even when women talk about sex just for the sake of casual sex I don't see how it's wrong for that to exist in a story.\n\nThe last thing I've seen people critique is how the book handles suicide as how it it treats it as a plot device. To that I say that suicide is definitely a plot device, but so what? I don't see the issue. I think the point is to show how close Toru really was to losing his own life. Kizuki, Naoko, and Hatsumi's deaths are kinda treated like they came out of nowhere by the people in their lives. Kizuki literally killed himself without clear reason at the start of the novel, people on the outside would have no idea what was going on with Hatsumi, and Naoko seemingly lost her mind back and forth and killed herself after getting better. But Toru, and the reader, knows that there was more to it. We learn about Kizuki from Naoko, and Naoko we know is haunted by Kizuki and unable to let it go, and Hatsumi is abused and tortured emotionally by Nagasawa. The deaths seem abrupt, but there was a clear path that led all of these people to despair, and Toru was on that path just as they were. I think it's fine to have characters kill themselves for the themes of a novel, people unfortunately kill themselves all the time, and suicides like the ones in NW are far from extraordinary or uncommon. I'm not sure how it seemed cheap to people, for me it felt sadly very real.\n\nAll of this brings me to Reiko who is pretty indefensible even for me. Any criticism of Reiko is probably fair and I think that the way her character is written is one of the biggest issues with the book. Her sexual trauma is genuinely upsetting, but also extremely confusing because it just never comes back around. Murakami made the weird choice to have Reiko's assailant be a child, and for Reiko to say multiple times that the girl had many victims, and then it never cam,e back or mattered. The fact that the girl never recurred as a character really begs the question of why did it have to be a kid in the first place, was it really necessary to write a rape scene involving a child when it never mattered again later on in the novel?\n\nI'm on the fence because it's challenging and things like this do happen in real life, but the fact that that circle never closed frustrated me. Especially when the fulfillment of Reiko's arc was having sex with Toru. This was the only sex in the novel that felt wholly unnecessary to me, it can only be explained by both of them being trashed and it feels like it cheapens both of their characters. It definitely struck me as lazy writing and as sex for the sake of sex. Reiko is the biggest sore thumb in the novel for me, as both points of the book that struck me as bad to questionable involved her.\n\nThe other main criticism I had of the book does involve women, but specifically their dialogue. I don't mind how sex is written and how the sexual lives of women are portrayed, but the way the dialogue is written is at times was pretty bad. It very much feels like a man's idea of a woman's voice at times, and it was frustrating. \n\nIf it isn't clear I loved this book. I thought it was a solid 8.5/10, with consistently beautiful prose and a heartbreaking story. Toru is annoying, but he's just a kid who is doing his best. I could have written 8 more paragraphs just defending Toru as a character. He's so well written- and consistently written too. He grows up and matures in a very believable fashion. As someone who has been a young and disaffected college student I found his story very relatable and that the novel accurately captured what it feels like to be 19 and scared while simultaneously the world and people around you are opening up to you in ways they didn't before. I can see why people hate him as a protagonist, but mostly I just pitied him, and hoped he would eventually make the right choices. I don't think a protagonist needs to be a good person or always do things right. Murakami writes a lot of flawed characters, and I think sometimes people like them too seriously, and take having written the character as an author's approval of the character's actions. I think Murakami very clearly disapproves of Toru's actions for most of the book, but also empathetically understands how a kid makes these mistakes and can learn for the better.\n\nI'm really curious to hear some thoughts on this, because as it says in the title I did find the criticisms to be overblown on the whole, and that some of them sound like it's just people being made uncomfortable by sex rather than the sex being poorly written.

Labour had just returned to power as New Labour after many years of Thatcherism, Tony Blair was the Prime Minister and the political mood was very much surrounding education. The UK Government at that time introduced a new national curriculum, there were the Blunkett reforms, various different schemes relating to children's education introduced and lots of Government ministers and media keen to talk about the importance of children's education.\n\nWhilst children's education\u00a0*is*\u00a0of course vitally important, I think over the years it's often come to be recognised that what politicians understand education to be about (and what is fed to the public by the media) is not necessarily the same thing as children becoming good, wholesome, well-rounded citizens who are safe and happy as they're growing up. There are two books in particular in which I feel Jacqueline Wilson made a conscious effort to explore this disparity:\u00a0*Vicky Angel*\u00a0and\u00a0*Love Lessons*. Both of these novels feature secondary schools that in reality appear to have a wildly different internal atmosphere to what they're perceived to be within their local communities, in terms of the experiences the main character has within them. I'll take both of them in the order that they were published.\n\n**Vicky Angel**\u00a0(2000)\n\nVicky Angel takes place at a school called Downfield, which Jade tells us at the start is 'considered a bit of a dump'. The headteacher is called Mr Failsworth (I think Wilson decided on the name of the school and the headteacher using words like 'down' and 'fail' on purpose, to really hammer home how bad this school is commonly understood to be). At the beginning, the school is trying very hard to improve its reputation by adding lots of extra-curricular activities and after-school clubs (and arguing about whether or not to get involved with any is what starts the row between Jade and Vicky that ends in Vicky's fatal road accident and kicks off the plot in the first place). We don't really find out whether or not the school is at all successful at improving its image - Jade is understandably too caught up with trauma for the rest of the book to really think about it or tell us - but somehow I don't get the impression it really does. At any rate, a fatal road accident right outside the school gates is hardly going to help improve anything, even if the school can't be blamed for that. It just creates a negative association.\n\nBut the difference between showing and telling really demonstrate themselves here, because I honestly think this seems to be the best school in any Jacqueline Wilson novel. Firstly, there do not seem to be\u00a0*any*\u00a0instances of bullying anywhere, which is pretty much unheard of in Wilson's books or in schools generally (I suppose arguably the late Vicky could be seen as a bully, but even she doesn't seem\u00a0*that*\u00a0bad - it doesn't seem like anyone was afraid of her or that she consciously hurt anyone). Everyone largely seems to feel safe inside the doors.\n\nAnd as tragic as this book is, it always gives me a cosy feeling that the entire faculty, both teachers and pupils, all rally around and support one another after the accident. The whole year group goes to the funeral together (I don't know if that's normal, but it's a nice touch and probably made Vicky's parents feel a bit better, as well as helping everyone to get closure). Jade in particular is treated exceptionally kindly by pretty much every member of staff. Mrs Cambridge, Miss Gilmore and Mr Lorrimer all go out of their way to help Jade - they all seem to have an instinct for when to try to get her mind off it, and when to just leave her alone to grieve. The other teachers don't take such an active role, but we hear that they're okay if she fails to hand her homework in and recognise the extenuating circumstances.\n\nThe pupils too are absolutely amazing. Sam's the most obvious one (and quite rightly so) but I'm always struck by how unbelievably kind Madeleine seems to be. Jade gets pretty nasty to her at times, but Maddy never takes it personally, continues to make an effort with her, shares her snacks with her, invites her out on weekend trips with her friends. Same with minor characters like Vicky's ex-boyfriend Ryan Harper, Jenny, and pretty much everyone else. I don't know how much was of their own volition and how much they were quietly encouraged to by teachers, but either way, it feels like this is a particularly kind and caring group of kids, kids who are always there for each other and understanding. It takes\u00a0*exceptional*\u00a0skill to foster this level of kindness consistently in children, especially angsty teenagers.\n\nSometimes it takes a tragic event like someone having been killed to show who's really on your side, and I think in this story Jade finds out that her school very much is, in spite of all appearances.\n\n**Love Lessons**\u00a0(2005)\n\n*Love Lessons*\u00a0takes place at a school called Wentworth, which like\u00a0*Vicky Angel*'s Downfield is also on a crusade to improve its public image. However, unlike Downfield, Wentworth seems to be doing a much better job at it. It's previously had a reputation for being quite rough - however, Miss Wilmott is the new headmistress, and she's determined to leave behind the old and radically improve things. She's young, eloquent, charismatic and really seems to have the enthusiasm and the energy to make a positive difference. Prue and Grace's mum is initially extremely reluctant to send her daughters there, and only considers it because there's no other school with vacancies - but she seems quite reassured by Miss Wilmott's presence. When Bernard regains his faculties a bit more and learns that the girls are at Wentworth, the mum quickly explains about the new headmistress who's doing such a great job dealing with all the problems.\n\nWentworth might be improving its public image extremely well, but it does\u00a0*not*\u00a0have the kind and understanding atmosphere of Downfield. On the contrary, it feels like a school that prides itself on not making exceptions for any child, no matter how vulnerable. Prue is in something of a similar position to Jade in terms of what's going on in her personal life; it must surely be on her notes that her father is seriously ill in hospital. But the teachers show very little compassion or understanding of the fact that she might not necessarily be at her best, being frequently told off and criticised for fairly minor things. Bullying is rife within this school, and very few teachers seem at all concerned about it (the one time an intervention is made, when Prue is fighting with Rita, both of them are immediately punished without anyone attempting to find out who started it - and in fact, Prue's actions were only in self-defence).\n\nMiss Wilmott's 'reforms' mostly just seem to involve being far more strict with everyone. Attitudes like that of the unpleasant English teacher, Mrs Godfrey, are probably exactly the sort of thing the school is being praised for doing - there's probably been a memo somewhere that says 'pupils should say the name of the teacher they're speaking to after every sentence', because this supposedly commands respect. I think the clearest indication of this is with the PE teacher, Miss Peters. She's a teacher that's quite difficult to get the measure of, because initially she seems very kind to Prue and is one of the few teachers who makes an effort to talk to her. However, a second later she prevents Prue from getting changed in the toilets and when Prue's bullied about her (admittedly inappropriate) underwear she only comes down on Prue for it. But when you think about the abrupt switch here, I think the underlying problem is that Miss Wilmott's policies don't allow teachers like Miss Peters any agency to find a diplomatic way to handle a difficult situation. The initial kindness we see from Miss Peters is probably a closer reflection of her actual personality - but the trouble is, Miss Wilmott has introduced policies saying things like 'pupils must change for PE in the changing room unless there's a religious exemption' (and there are all sorts of reasons a child might feel uncomfortable taking their clothes off in front of their peers) and that enforcing correct uniform always takes priority over dealing with bullying. If that's the school rule, there's not really anything Miss Peters can do about it, even if she'd like to be there for the new girl. This also emphasises the importance of teachers being allowed to use their discretion in how to deal with pupils, rather than expecting them to stick to a rigid script all the time.\n\nMiss Wilmott reminds me quite a lot of Katharine Birbalsingh, who commonly appears in the UK media and is frequently dubbed 'Britain's Strictest Headmistress'. Her school, the Michaela school in Wembley Park, London, is known for its unusually strict rules, which include the pupils being forbidden from talking to each other at all apart from at break and lunchtime. Jacqueline Wilson almost certainly didn't base Miss Wilmott on her because Birbalsingh wasn't a public figure at the time she wrote it, but there have been many headteachers who have had similar approaches, going off the public perception of the way education should be. And the important thing about this is, Miss Wilmott's approach and the way the teachers react to it is what creates the circumstances for someone like Keith Raxberry to be able to groom pupils (and I do not believe Prue's the only person he's groomed - I think Sarah stood out very much as someone who either had been groomed by him in the past or that he would go for next, and there are probably others). The first technique he uses to groom Prue and probably other pupils is that he has created a reputation for himself as being the school's resident nice teacher. It's very easy to be that, because none of the other teachers even come close. His encouragement to the kids to call him Rax, for instance - that perhaps wouldn't be so bad in some schools, but in a school that is so draconian and strict, it sets him apart from the other teachers significantly. It creates the impression of 'I'm on your side, don't tell anyone!' And from that point on, he can be the teacher kids confide in, and then get an impression of which kids don't have strong support networks at home and are easy to lure into a trap. If the other teachers weren't like this, Raxberry would have been caught out a lot earlier. Take Mrs Godfrey, for example - she probably would have been quite close to Prue if she'd only been nice, because Prue was good at her subject. So Prue would at some point have mentioned to her that she goes to Mr Raxberry's house to look after his kids (remember, Prue doesn't know this is wrong - for all she knows, the kids hang out with the teachers outside school all the time). And then Mrs Godfrey could have said, 'Hold on, Prue, he's not supposed to invite you to his house. I think I might have to have a word with the headmistress about this.' And then it would have all come out, far earlier.\n\nThe end of\u00a0*Love Lessons*\u00a0is very controversial - but I like it, because I think it's a commentary on that kind of education. Prue is victim-blamed, disputes she's had about irrelevant things are brought up, and she's quietly shunted out of the school, whilst her abuser gets off scot-free and is allowed to continue teaching there. The really, really sinister thing about this is the fact that if you look at it from Miss Wilmott's perspective, you can see her logic and it makes complete sense because of what her priorities are. She is there to improve the school's image. The governors chose to employ her, as opposed to a different head, precisely because this is what she would be good at. And the course of action she elects to take with Prue achieves\u00a0*just that*. She knows that if it gets out that there's a child molester on the staff that it won't look good for the reforms she's trying to make, and she's correct in that, it would make the school look awful. Just as she has done at every other point in the book, she prioritises that over the safety and comfort of her pupils, and kicks out any pupil she perceives as a threat to it. She'll get great exam results probably, and be heralded for saving a failing school. But at what cost?\n\nThere are a lot of headteachers like this, and I really hope that in real life they would not take their priority of maintaining their school's reputation quite as far as this (although I really don't want to say categorically that's the case, there are so many awful real-life instances where kids have been let down badly by people who were meant to protect them). But even if a headteacher would draw the line at turning a blind eye to grooming and inappropriate relationships, it still creates the circumstances in which they could happen. It still creates an atmosphere in school where no child would feel safe confiding in a teacher about something they're going through, for fear of getting into trouble themselves. That creates a situation that makes children profoundly unsafe, even if they wouldn't in reality be blamed for it.\n\n\\--\n\nIt's absolutely fascinating to think how different\u00a0*Vicky Angel*\u00a0and\u00a0*Love Lessons*\u00a0would be if the schools in them were switched, isn't it? And I think it really says something about what we believe should constitute a 'good school'. It doesn't matter if you have great exam results and well-behaved kids if the kids are potentially going through awful things and you're doing nothing at all to support them. Likewise, no matter what flaws you have as a school, it goes an awfully long way if you've got a kind support network and a community spirit where everyone is there for each other, like in\u00a0*Vicky Angel*.", "date_utc": 1761044205.0, "title": "(Long essay) I want to talk about the way Jacqueline Wilson explores educational perception versus educational reality", "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "score": 37, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1oc9t0g/long_essay_i_want_to_talk_about_the_way/"}, {"id": "1ocfb0a", "name": "t3_1ocfb0a", "content": "", "date_utc": 1761058866.0, "title": "Looks like a book.

Drawing from his experiences as a young oncologist, Mukherjee turns what could have been a clinical document into an eloquent chronicle of humanity\u2019s long, uneasy relationship with the disease.\n\nThe book begins as a simple medical journal but quickly expands into something monumental, a biography not of a person, but of an illness that has shaped countless lives. Mukherjee traces cancer\u2019s first recorded mention in ancient Egypt to the modern age of chemotherapy and genetic research, connecting each scientific breakthrough with real patient stories. The result is both educational and deeply moving.\n\nMukherjee\u2019s prose is elegant and empathetic. His portraits of patients like Carla Reed and Barbara Bradfield reveal the courage, pain and stubborn hope that define the cancer experience. The book can be emotionally demanding, especially for readers who have witnessed the disease firsthand as Mukherjee does not shy away from the suffering, nor from the limits of medicine\u2019s power to heal.\n\nThe book\u2019s greatest strength lies in its scope and clarity. Mukherjee makes complex biology like retroviruses, proto-oncogenes, tumor suppressors accessible without diluting its depth. If you are a person like me with no medicine background, that same scientific precision can feel dense and challenging at times, be prepared to periodically pause reading the book to google things.\u00a0\n\nWhat sets the book apart is its honesty. Mukherjee celebrates medical progress without romanticizing it. He acknowledges the arrogance, hubris and false promises that have marked the fight against cancer, as well as the quiet triumphs that have changed millions of lives. His conclusion is realistic yet hopeful: there may never be a universal cure, but science and compassion continue to evolve side by side.\n\nUltimately, *The Emperor of All Maladies* is a remarkable achievement thats beautifully written, meticulously researched and deeply humane. It is not an easy read\u00a0 but it is a profoundly rewarding one. Mukherjee reminds us that the story of cancer is also the story of humanity itself: resilient, inventive and endlessly striving to understand the forces that shape life and death.\n\n8/10", "date_utc": 1760998355.0, "title": "The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer by Siddhartha Mukherjee.

I read the book in one day, and can't stop thinking about the ending. I didn't see this in any reviews I read, so wanted to see what other may think. Spoilers ahead. \n\nI was wondering if the whole time travelling premise of the book is a ploy by the unreliable narrator, Cassandra. (There are some points where Cassandra makes a point of telling the reader she created the beginnings and ends of the book). \n\nWe never learn any concrete details about how the time travelling works or came to be other than Cassandra can seemingly close her eyes and keep redoing life over and over again, and it just kind of all of a sudden began. Cassandra can only go back as far as the day she first met her x-boyfriend. I am wondering if that day is also significant because it is the first day Cassandra's sister tries to contact her and tell Cassandra she has autism via a pomegranate scented envelope (Cassandra is estranged from her sister, Art, and refuses Art's attempts at contact. Cassandra omits telling the reader about her sister for a good chunk of the book. I just read the book in one sitting, so those dates may not line up exactly but I think they do??) \n\nI am wondering if the story is actually- that right before Cassandra time travels for the first time, she has the actual first encounter with her sister, Art, where Cassandra learns she has autism for the first time. When the first time travelling meltdown occurs is Cassandra melting down from her very bad day and this new life-changing news??\n\nIn this reading, Cassandra goes down a rabbit hole reminiscing about if she would be having the worst day ever if she had opened the letter from Art 4 months ago- if Cassandra's life would be any different if she knew she had autism sooner. Could she have prevented the really bad day of being dumped, fired, about to lose her apartment, no banana muffins if Cassandra had known she was autistic earlier and could have prevented her autistic tendencies from sabotaging her? \n\nIn Cassandra's book, she uses time travel as the literary device instead of just seeing inside her head as she ruminates over her last 4 months and if her changes would have changed anything, while she is in an existential crisis (probably just in her room, hiding in bed, processing everything). \n\nSome facts that could point to this reading of the book: \n- we never see further into the future than when she is in the doorway of that pub melting down, before she first time travels (on the very bad day)\n- Cassandra is keeping things from us as the reader/ she isn't a truthful or trustworthy narrator (ex. what are the envelopes, her sister) \n- all of the things changed or discovered with Cassandra's time travel stem from seeing her actions, others' actions or words, and the situation differently now than she did the first time she lived it/ playing with the consequences to see which actions she did that caused the very bad day to happen (could she have prevented the very bad day?)\n- Cassandra's sister, Art, at the end of the book is knowledgeable of Cassandra's time travelling abilities. Art seems to be the only one who knows, and accepts it as \"real\". When Cassandra wants to time travel again to see if she can have Art successfully stay with Cassandra's x-boyfriend, Art doesn't want Cassandra to time travel and give up everything else that Cassandra successfully fixed. Cassandra says that it is okay because everyone else won't know, but she, Cassandra, will know at least. Art is also the one who tells Cassandra she has autism (as she found a diagnostic report in their parents' attic 4 months ago). Art wants to help Cassandra do what she needs to do, so the two can repair their relationship. I think Art may also help Cassandra in processing the past 4 months, which is why Art becomes enmeshed in the story (Art with Will, Art living with Cassandra's roommates, etc)\n- Cassandra tells us she cocooned away for 6 months after her parents died and doesn't remember much about what happened- processing the death after they died and the fall out with her sister. It would be reasonable that she would need a similar processing experience for her very bad day-- and before she time travels the first time- she is in fact melting down. There is even the notion that Art was at the edges of a lot of the time travelling scenes and Cassandra didn't realize or was trying to block her out. \n- Cassandra had wanted to time travel back to her parents' death and prevent their deaths, but couldn't. We later learn after she reunites with her sister, that in reality, there was nothing Cassandra could have done to prevent that car accident (despite her sister saying otherwise at the funeral). I think the 4 months ago beginning date is important, but not because of meeting Will that day. \n\nThe \"time travelling\" or ruminating/ writing a time travelling book about the last 4 months allowed Cassandra to figure out how to go forward after the very bad day, and move on to her next chapter (I imagine: move back to her dead parents' house, attend Cambridge for Classical Studies, reconnect with her sister, get over her x boyfriend, be happy she lost her job, move on from her apartment, grieve and move on from her parents' death, realize that there were some good people and potential friends that she had in her life- Sal and Sophie). \n\nUpon finishing this book, I went to the reviews, excited to see what everyone would say about the book. I found a lot of people disappointed about the lack of exciting time travelling, lack of spelling out the mechanics of the time travelling, bored by the Greek tid bits, unable to connect to Cassandra as a character and surprised Cassandra didn't know she had autism. \n\nI am unsure if being neurodivergent allows me to \"get\" this book more than some reviewers I found, but I really related to the book- even if I do not share many of the autistic traits Cassandra has. I really related to the idea of constantly being unsure of what you did wrong, misreading social cues, questioning what if, and the experience of being late diagnosed/ masking your neurodivergence as a survival mechanism with limited support. This book was very vulnerable in putting things out for the reader to see (like lack of long term romantic partners) without it being a joke or quirk, but showing the why/ the real unmasked version of events. \n\nMaybe my interpretation of the ending, and thereby reinterpretation of the whole book, also comes from my own late life diagnosis and questions about if certain aspects of my life would be different if I \"knew\" sooner. Would I want to time travel back further into my life and potentially change hard things by \"knowing\" sooner?? \n\nThe author, Holly Smale, wrote the book after being diagnosed with autism at 39.", "date_utc": 1760981075.0, "title": "Cassandra in Reverse (US)/ Cassandra Complex (UK) by Holly Smale", "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "score": 12, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1obo682/cassandra_in_reverse_us_cassandra_complex_uk_by/"}, {"id": "1obk3r1", "name": "t3_1obk3r1", "content": "Maybe my confirmation bias colors my opinion here, but I think this is a decent book.

An LLM is just an algorithm picking likely next words or images based on tagging or description. I\u2019ve called it spicy autocorrect or a jumped up Markov chain. And in small, niche applications LLMs and neural networks are great! But when you try to make it a general thing - a google killer, an agent, an artist, an author, a stand in for people, a panopticon supervisor - it falls way short. And if you\u2019re selling it as something that can be smarter than people, it\u2019s a con. Worse, the people selling it may believe the con themselves.\n\nBender and Hanna get into the details of the hype - what's really being sold, how it\u2019s being sold. They also get into why we as humans see the output of LLMs as a sort of people - because we use language for so much that we can\u2019t help but seeing language as an indication of intelligence as we understand it day to day. It isn\u2019t though. Again, LLMs don\u2019t learn like an infant - they are just picking the next most likely word based on a statistical model.\u00a0\n\nThey also get into a lot of what LLMs are built on - not just stolen creative works - but also faulty definitions of intelligence. Definitions based on cultural and racist biases, ones that favor white, middle to upper class. More broadly, it favors WEIRD (Western, European, Industrial, Rich and Democratic). They also get into how this is all tied to TESCREAL (transhumanism, Extropianism, singularitarianism, cosmism, Rationalism, Effective Altruism, and longtermism)\u00a0 and how AI doomers and boosters are opposite sides of the same coin - getting on the LLM train to produce artificial general intelligence to save use all and spread humanity throughout the galaxy.\n\nYeah, the reality is that weird. And they don\u2019t even get into Roko\u2019s Basilisk!\n\nThe authors also get into how to deal with AI hype - by asking questions. I borrowed these from chapter 7 Do You Believe in Hope After Hype?\n\n1. What is being automated? What goes in, and what comes out?\n2. Can you connect the inputs to outputs?\n3. Are these systems being described as human?\n4. How is the system evaluated?\n5. Who benefits from this technology, who is harmed, and what recourse do they have?\n6. How was the system developed? What are their labor and data practices?\n\nI was glad for that chapter.\n\nBender and Hanna do bring the receipts - at least a third of the book is references and sources.\u00a0\n\nStill, I felt like this was too long.

It's something we already knew going in; we just didn't know how he did it.\n\nA key theme revolves around Haymitch's failed attempt to defy the Capitol, despite some success in breaking the Arena. The Capitol manipulates the story of his win to excise any aspects of his defiance, and Haymitch loses those he loves most. In order to forget his problems, he turns to drink, which is the habit we see in the original trilogy.\n\nIf that sounds dark and heartbreaking, that's because it is, and the storyline leaves many readers sobbing. Why do so many people love it? I wonder if some superfans of the series are blinded by nostalgia. But what's really the point of it? Is it just to show the power of Capitol propaganda? Apparently Collins was partly inspired by the views of philosopher David Hume about implicit submission and \"the easiness with which the many are governed by the few\". The title also has its origins in Hume. Perhaps she also has something to say about the power of media narratives to distort the truth, and maybe she is exploring whether we can discern between what is real and what is not. But I find it hard to interpret the book as a serious treatment of these themes, because if there is a message, it's far from clear. There\u2019s certainly a lot of pessimism, and no real hope.\n\nIn the end, there doesn't really seem to be much of a point other than backstory, and it's just an additional Hunger Games story. Sceptics will see it as milking the Hunger Games cow by giving more of the same formula and telling us more about the same world. But the storytelling doesn\u2019t feel as good, it's not as gripping or well written as the main trilogy, and it brings us to an ending that is tragically painful, and depressingly pessimistic. While there is some storyline, it doesn't add a great deal to the Hunger Games universe, and if anything, it might create some plot holes in the original trilogy. To be fair, the author is hampered by the fact that she knows we already understand how the world of the Hunger Games works.\n\nHunger Games fanboys will lap this up, but the rest of us can comfortably give this a miss and stick with the main trilogy.

Now, I believe the movie pales in comparison to its masterful literary counterpart, but I still believe the film was scarier. But, you could likely blame this on the medium and not the artist. However, What I do not understand is that I\u2019m a horrible scardy cat! I hate horror movies, yet the Shining did not really do it for me. This is not to say the novel did not absolutely consume me over its near 500 page span. It was utterly fantastic.\n\nIs this just a me thing?\n\nI\u2019m not sure, but regardless, down below, I\u2019ll share my first impression review immediately after I finished the book, straight from my notes app.\n\nThe Shining-Stephen King\n\n\u2026oh boy. They were not kidding when they said that Stephen king was good. REAL good. I\u2019m in a loss for words. I finished it only a few seconds ago. One word, masterpiece. Masterpiece of tension and horror. Masterpiece of exposition and character Masterpiece of dialogue and description It is an across the board 10/10.\n\nThe book is a slow burn, but it\u2019s a snowball. A real violent snowball, and towards the second half, the reader understands there\u2019s no stopping it now. The way Jack\u2019s character transformed from a sympathetic, flawed, protagonist/ antihero, into a villainous and morally destroyed shell of himself, and lastly into a literal incarnation of the demonic hotel when the Overlook at last takes full control, is absolutely, draw dropping, unbelievable writing. A character development smooth like sanded furniture, it is not jarring or unexpected. Your fear of Jack Torrence and the man he has become is no suprise. The real turning point of course is the night where he hallucinates the entire party and gets drunk on ghost martinis. At this point, the spirit of the Overlook takes over and it is too late. Now, the main characters, the protagonists, become fully Wendy, Danny, and Hallorann. Jack dies here. The characters acknowledge it.\n\nDanny\u2019s confrontation with Jack where he calls out that this horrid monster is not his father anymore is such an amazing climax. Then, we get the redemption, so satisfying, where Jack breaks through for just a moment, and then true hotel beats in what\u2019s left of Jack\u2019s face with the mallet. Cementing the possession fully.\n\nThe boiler explosion was perfect and such an amazing way to end it. Burn the place DOWN. Beautiful. And I\u2019m so glad Hallorann survived. The entire novel just felt so REAL. Most likely because of dialogue but also how King paints such vivid windows into his character\u2019s minds. They jump off the page, and for a moment, you forget you are reading fiction.\n\nAnd I feel like i cannot not address the movie\u2026. Which in comparison to this book\u2026 is a complete and utter dumpster fire that can never compare to its masterful literary counterpart. The book is infinitely superior in every way, and the cuts and editions to the movie, and it\u2019s short run time compared to the novels depth and length, are the pitfalls that the film adaptation loses itself to. Further solidifying the claim that, \u201cThe books are always better than the movies.\u201d I will say\u2026 the twins and bloody elevator would have been cool additions, and also\u2026 the movie was scarier. I do not believe books can be truly scary. This one did not freak me out or make my skin crawl. It was utterly absorbing and engaging, however, I was not \u201cscared\u201d like movies scare me. I believe that is due to the medium and not the artist however. And Stephen King has every right to hate the infamous Kubrick adaptation of his book. The movie would be amazing if it weren\u2019t for its literary counter part surpassing it in almost every way except, ironically, in the horror department.\n\nThe Shining is a masterpiece, and it is among the ranks of my favorite books ever, however, I cannot proclaim this openly because of its\u2026 interesting content. But, do i regret reading it? Not in the slightest. Even in its slow troughs, the book kept me engaged with how masterful king writes people. And certainly, our patience and commitment was rewarded when the plot climaxed throughout.\n\nTo conclude, it is an utter masterpiece. And I\u2019m sure I will be tossing it around in my mind over the next few days if not for the rest of my life. The novel has grown me as a reader, and a writer, and was a pleasure all around. Good work King. I\u2019m sure to read you again and again.

It\u2019s not a huge event, but we\u2019ve had a small, semi-regular group. We meet every other Friday at 2:30pm ET for 30 minutes, and we read one book over the course of three meetings. This year, we planned the entire reading schedule together. Everyone suggested books, voted, and the top picks made the list. We also agreed on the meeting time, and everyone has the calendar invites.

Some had read it multiple times already and were excited to talk about it with new readers.

The fact that he writes in first person makes it so it feels like you're going along with the one who is narrarating the story.\n\n \nI'm sad that the show didn't do justice to the book.

So I would really like to hear from people who enjoyed the book, what you enjoyed about it?\n\nThere is a lot that I liked about the book, like the beautiful prose, the notion of a mystery revolving around a book, which was inspired (though reminded me too much of *If on a winters night a traveller...*). As someone who used to live in Barcelona, I loved that the story was so immersed in the city, and it read almost as a love letter to Barcelona. I also liked the running theme of parental failures and the relationships between the male characters.\n\nBut now that I have finished the book, it has left no impression on me. I don't feel moved by the story. I solved the mystery quite early on, so I found a lot of unnecessary hand-holding in the second half. And the end was very cliche, compared to the beginning: the male hero does something heroic and gets the girl who gives him a son.\n\nPlus, I found it incredibly sexist. It is true that the book acknowledged that women pay the price of men's sins, and it highlights the sexism women faced, through Sophie and Jacinta's relationships with their husbands and Nuria's sexual harassment at work. But all the women in this story exist to serve the men, either as their caretakers or as their fantasies. And if, like Clara, they refuse to fulfill the fantasies of the main cast, then the story punished them. Clara's ending read like an incel revenge fantasy. And the men take no responsibility for the damage they do to women.

I couldn't have named a contribution he made to the era apart from giving the Queen someone to mourn for decades and lending his name to some public monuments. It is, after all, the *Victorian* age.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe Albert that emerges in this biography is a much more talented, interesting, and active man than history gives him credit for. He could stand tall in an era filled with remarkably accomplished personalities. He was intelligent, well educated, and musical; Gill reports that \"Albert could have succeeded as a professor, geologist, botanist, statistician, musician, engineer, or bureaucrat.\" He headed up, with brilliant success, one of the most characteristic achievements of the Victorian era\u2014the Crystal Palace exhibition of 1851\u2014working tirelessly on this and many other projects.\n\n\n\nWas he moralistic and prudish? Yes, and that was just what his Saxe-Coburg handlers wanted. Regency aristocrats had badly damaged the English public's perception of royalty with their licentiousness, free spending, and irresponsibility. Not only that, rampant venereal disease was ravaging the noble houses of Europe\u2014along with equally rampant social unrest. Both in England and Germany, kingmakers realized that the success of the English monarchy depended on adopting more middle-class, Evangelical values of moral purity. Albert was specifically cultivated to be pure and virginal. So, of course, was Victoria, but Albert's upbringing was very unusual at a time when it was simply expected that aristocratic men would sow their wild oats.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnd the Saxe-Coburgers schemed wisely. \"Albert would be their man, a man in their own image\u2014in all things but one. Albert would be virtuous, he would be clean, and he would be monogamous. As a result, he would have healthy children, and he would found a dynasty that would rule Europe. This grand plan actually came to pass.\" It's astonishing when you think about it.\n\n\n\nAs to the marriage itself, Gill is interested in exploring how Victoria and Albert negotiated all the weirdnesses involved in a highly misogynistic society where a Queen happens to rule. Victoria had been told all her life that she needed a man to make decisions for her, and she gave much lip service to this idea, but when push came to shove, she often wanted her own way. She loved and needed Albert, so it's fascinating to see how the political and the personal mix. As Gill says, the \"lived reality\" of this marriage was \"an extraordinary feat achieved against the odds.\"\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\nVictoria's ability to stand up for herself is all the more remarkable considering how little independence she had growing up: \"For the first eighteen years of her life, Queen Victoria was never in a room by herself. Someone was with her not only when she ate and did her lessons and took her exercise but when she slept, washed, and used the chamber pot. . . . \\[She\\] once told her daughters that until the day of her accession, she was forbidden to go down a staircase unless someone held her hand.\"\u00a0\n\n\n\nYet right from the first, she loved the business of being Queen. She read all the items in her dispatch box, wrote long memoranda, and in essence had a demanding full-time job. Nevertheless, she intended to be a good wife and on her marriage give up the business of governing. And in any case she almost immediately became pregnant; the fertile Queen ended up with nine children. These confinements, often difficult and followed by what we'd now call post-partum depression, also kept her out of public life for long stretches. Again and again, though, she made her mark. As Gill points out, Lytton Strachey did not include Albert in his *Eminent Victorians*.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThis book was a pleasure to read. Gill explains complexities with admirable clarity and liveliness, and she often brings in the telling detail (as above, with poor Victoria unable even to use the chamber pot alone). This dual biography ends with Albert's death, so readers interested in Victoria's life after Albert will need to look elsewhere. One small quibble: considering how careful Gill is to name and thank all her editors, it would have been nice not to see mistakes like \"palate\" for \"palette\" and \"discrete\" for \"discreet.\" But this is a very small quibble indeed for this well-researched, fascinating book.\n\n", "date_utc": 1760630395.0, "title": "We Two: Victoria and Albert: Rulers, Partners, Rivals by Gillian Gill (2009)", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "score": 21, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1o8a2c1/we_two_victoria_and_albert_rulers_partners_rivals/"}, {"id": "1o82ca2", "name": "t3_1o82ca2", "content": "I picked this book up at a sale and read it last year and sometime think about it too.

The things that actively happen or happened are sometimes short and sweet and are very easy to imagine. Regardless of what mood I am, I enjoy it because if I'm sick or tired I can just gloss over the text without actively thinking and then I can go think about it later, and if I'm really in the mood to read I have whole paragraphs of someone else's brain to pick through. \n\nWith these books, especially We Need to Talk About Kevin, the narrator presents herself the way that she wants to be seen. She says a lot of things that I either agree with or disagree with or things I can think about, and the distance makes it so there's less room for interpretation and there's only so much room for my opinions.\n. I am not ever going to be able to help her or educate her or put my own two cents in. I'm stuck in my own brain, which is great when I need cathartic stress and it's an aspect of horror that many things don't maintain. It adds a layer to unreliable narrator as well. If she ever backpedals or refers back to something and tries to weave, I have to accept it. If she turns a situation into something it must likely isn't, it is the way it is and that's the only way it can be. In the case where she is lying, she's just going to lie to herself for 400 pages straight to the point where she believes herself and since she has 400 pages to work with, she often gets close to convincing me that my beliefs aren't truly my beliefs or making me feel bad for her when I am upset with her. She is completely in control, I can't ask questions and I can't try to predict or infer. \n\n(But at the same time, the story is more in my control than a normal story would be just because information is presented in a way where I'm not always going to get an answer for something that happens or I just have to take it as presented or I take only what is given and we're probably not coming back to said topic in a pivotal way, so I can use my imagination and build my own story.)\n\nIn general for books that are based on diary entries or based on a character's recollection of events, passive is good. it is much easier to actually believe the character and get immersed. For one, the character is more fleshed out and two, I can 100% believe the main character or narrator telling me about their life or feelings or general vibes with a few key events mixed in compared to a character remembering a whole day or a whole month or an entire set of events. The latter only works when there is indeed an unreliable narrator, the narrator has a condition that allows superior memory or the character's intentionally trying to tell the story and they're going to fabricate the hell out of it and pull it out of pocket. For me personally, the story has to be really well done and I have to care quite a bit to actually follow something like that.", "date_utc": 1760590719.0, "title": "I love passive books so much.

The way both books carefully craft this small Northeastern town, both take a loving look at its residents, despite the dark secrets of most - if not all - of them. And the slow destruction of the town by insidious supernatural forces, though in King the bad guys win and in Straub they don't.

Not that I mind, I think Straub's book succeeds better.\n\nPart of that is the characters. Ricky Hawthorne is such a wholesome, such a solid (though small and often weak) bastion of goodness. And Stella! A couple like them born in the early 20th Century probably wouldn't have even had the language for \"loving, stable polyamory\", but they understand each other and it works. Peter's a great character too. He starts the book as such a morally weak character, so ready to become unthinkingly complicit in Jim Hardie's crimes, and he grows imperceptibly into more of a moral backbone than Ricky or Don. And by the way, Jim was great too. He reminded me of Frank Booth in *Blue Velvet*, just this figure of constant, drunken, malevolence. The devil on Peter's shoulder.\n\nAs for weaknesses in the book: Like I said, I loved it. But I wasn't too convinced by the bad guys. I get the kind of dead-eyed, immortal evil they represent, but I think that archetype was done better by King (in *'Salem's Lot*'s Barlow and Straker, *The Stand*'s Flagg), not to mention Lynch's Frank Booth and Killer BOB, and Anne Rice's Lestat. Plus I wish the bad guys could have been vanquished by some more clever means than just stabbin' and choppin'. I mean if the baddies themselves are that clever, shouldn't it take something clever to defeat them?\n\nLastly, this isn't a criticism or a point of praise, just an observation. Did Straub say to someone, \"I'm going to write a horror book!\" and they said, \"Cool! What will you write about: ghosts, witches, werewolves, vampires, zombies?\" and he said \"Yes.\"\n\nAnyway, if you want a long, luxurious read for spooky month, this is a great one to get lost in.\n\nEDIT: I was right about *'Salem's Lot*! Here's Straub quoted in King's *Danse Macabre*: \"I wanted to work on a large canvas. *'Salem's Lot* showed me how to do this without getting lost among a lot of minor characters [...] I had been imbued with the notion that horror stories are best when they are ambiguous and low key and restrained. Reading [*'Salem's Lot*], I realized that idea was self-defeating. Horror stories were best when they were big and gaudy, when the natural operatic quality in them was let loose.\"", "date_utc": 1760487756.0, "title": "My Halloween read this year: Ghost Story by Peter Straub", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "score": 72, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1o6whdh/my_halloween_read_this_year_ghost_story_by_peter/"}, {"id": "1o83k56", "name": "t3_1o83k56", "content": "I can't remember where I read that - but it's true. Stories- books introduce us to the wonderful insane world of adult love- not the plot device of children's stories, the Prince falling in love with Cinderella, not the boring matrimonial life of our parents, aunts, and uncles but real, beautiful love, the kind you feel in your stomach, except writers and poets felt it would be more poetic to say heart (and of course they are right). \n\nThe kind of love that makes you do insane things.  \n\nYou're not going to believe this, but for me, it was Joseph Heller's *God Knows*, a book that literally no-one else I know has ever heard of, and that I've never heard mentioned outside my head, a book that despite going to a churchy elementary school where we recited the Lord's Prayer every morning (none of this wussy national anthem shite kids have forced down their throats these days!) completely shaped my understanding of the Bible, not to mention Judaism, god, parents, children, sex, rape, love, music, poetry, madness, being young, growing old, life, death and everything else that remotely matters. \n\nDavid and Bathsheba. Funny, huh? Of all the great lovers of  history, they are the pair that I randomly stumbled upon first in my early teens. Later of course there were others- I think I wrote about *Brideshead Revisited* in an earlier post. But Heller imprinted those two on me first. \n\nDavid fell in love with Bathsheba the moment he laid eyes on her, bathing naked on her rooftop, when he was also out on an evening stroll on the his rooftop, trying to relax from the worries of ruling his war-torn kingdom. (He was part of the reason it was war-torn, at that point. He just loved fighting, couldn't get enough of it. Also was very good at it, by his own account, and that of the Bible). Later he finds out she was there bathing on purpose, to catch the king's eye. It works. His eye is caught. He summons her and lays with her that same evening. Then he plots for her husband's death, so he can marry her. Completely logical.\n\nBathsheba is a blonde bitch. Heller goes on and on about her fair skin, her weight gain in her later years, her freckles and moles, her misshapen toes, her scheming manipulations. Despite the dark beauty of his slim Semitic concubines, David can only think about her. We get it, we get it. Blond girls have more fun, since ancient times. I have no idea if Bathsheba was blonde in the Bible, but she certainly was by the time Heller laid his hands on her. Or rather, pen. Hehe. Get it? Pen. \n\nAnyway.

I wanted to hear about what happened when she finished the book, when the drafts were given to the family, how they reacted. \n\nSince finishing the book, I read the archived blog from her brother Tyler. From there I learned that \u201cShawn\u2019s\u201d true name was Travis, and then I learned that he passed away in 2024. \nTyler\u2019s blog was difficult for me to read. He was sharing his side of things and how it was for him growing up, all the time not acknowledging that things were very different for his little sister. First she was girl and second there was so much time between their upbringings. He made the point that there were lots of books about world war 2 and even the Diary of Anne Frank, but that was all when he was going through school and Tara was not born yet or extremely young. With the condition of the home, could those books be found? Were they ruined? Covered in mold or mildew and tossed away? \nI also wanted to address another poster here on Reddit who did not believe Tara could have studied enough to get the proper score on the ACT which I found shocking. \nIf you are learning to a test, it\u2019s fairly straightforward to find out what you need to know and make a point to learn it. Tara is also honest about her mother helping her because she wanted to learn. She says in the book that they struggled through, that neither of them knew what they were doing. But there is also research out there or maybe it is anecdotal that children just click with topics we\u2019ve been trying to teach them and that a 7 year old might be given 0 education in math and catch up to his peers who have been doing math since pre-K in a matter of weeks. So I don\u2019t think any of this is a lie. \nTara dedicates the book to Tyler who was an example getting out of Buck\u2019s Peak and going to school. He inspired her drive and allowed her to see it as a possibility for her too and was there for her to call on, as seldomly as that may have happened. \nThank God for all those people looking out for Tara. The Pastor at the church in her school and the professors who saw something special in her and pushed her forward. What a beautiful yet heartbreaking story of one\u2019s life.

Within the first quarter of the book, I already knew it would be a 5 star read for me. Since then, I have read two more of her books and loved them both.

This book, set in the 1970s, takes place primarily in Alaska. A vietnam soldier is wrestling with PTSD and other psychological scars as he attempts to move his family to falsely precieved safety. Two women are left fighting for life and love in brutal conditions. Strong character development, beautiful writing; I highly recommend. \n\nThe Nightingale - 5/5. Set in Germany in the 1940s, two sisters navigate life through the German occupation. One rebellous and the other cautious, the sisters navigate fear, love, and resistance. The writing was captivating, and I felt like I was standing in the room with the characters. Excellent read. \n\nThe Four Winds - 4.5/5 - I loved this book. It was a little slow in the beginning, but overall, it was an amazing read. This book got me in my motherhood feels. If you currently do or have ever felt the pain of raising a teenager, then you would understand. This book follows a family through the 1930's Dust Bowl era as they try their luck and head from Texas to California.

I wish a lot of project managers I know would read it. So when I found out he wrote a book that addressed end of life issues, I had to read it. It did not disappoint.

No, but it's still good. 7\u00bd stars, rounding down to 7. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nGawande organizes it in 8 chapters - the Independent Self, Things Fall Apart, Dependence, Assistance, A Better Life, Letting Go, Hard Conversations and Courage, with an epilog. And yes, it does have citations of a lot of reference materials. He wouldn't be a surgeon or physician without them. But, this is also a very personal book for Gawande. It talks about his grandmother-in-law's decline and death, about his patients, friends, his grandfather and father. And their deaths. So, yeah, it isn't light reading.\n\nI particularly wanted to know how Dr. Gawande wanted to address the medicalization of death, especially since he's a surgeon - folks who routinely make heroic, lifesaving interventions. He didn't disappoint because he addressed it directly by looking at the history, how things have changed and by also admitting his own role in that process. Then by ***changing***. I admire that he did that. So, on to the book.\n\nHe writes about how we medicalized death over the 20th century, how nursing homes came into being and used the asylum and hospital models. Things which strip away independence and dignity for convenience of managing the patient, er, resident.\u00a0\n\nHe also writes about how all the heroic medical interventions at the last stages of life for old age make it so much worse, spending huge amounts of money for relatively little time and time of such poor quality. Also, these interventions can shorten life, as well as make it a misery. He gives examples of how these deaths happen and brings the receipts as well.\u00a0\n\n**Being Mortal** is a thought provoking book, but Gawande stops short. He shows us medicalized death is bad, with examples, but doesn't get into how to have a good death. He doesn't go into specifics, which is what we need. Fortunately, there is **The Good Death** by Suzanne B. O'Brien which ***does*** get into those details.\u00a0\n\nDid this have the same impact on me as the **Checklist Manifesto**? No. But it does start a conversation we need to have about death and how we will experience it.\u00a0\n\nAlso, seeing some of Gawande's personal experiences with death as doctor, family member, friend, student of death and, ultimately, a son are moving and lend immediacy to the book. Still, by failing to prescribe how to have a good death, Gawande stops short of where he needs to go.\u00a0\n\n7\u00bd stars, rounding down to 7. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n", "date_utc": 1760372996.0, "title": "Being Mortal by Atul Gawande", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "score": 71, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1o5okbc/being_mortal_by_atul_gawande/"}, {"id": "1o6zllg", "name": "t3_1o6zllg", "content": "**A great short story where Sherlock Holmes meets Lovecraft**\n\nI've always loved the short stories about detective Sherlock Holmes and his abilities of deduction.

I had to write this before it fades away, because The Hero of Ages is, without a doubt, the most perfect thing I\u2019ve ever read in my 27 years of life. I don\u2019t even know how to explain it without feeling like words are too small for what I feel. It\u2019s simply\u2026 perfect.\n\nWhen I think of order, logic, science, and physics, the invisible structure that keeps the universe from falling apart, this book becomes the purest reflection of that. It\u2019s those concepts, translated into the language of fantasy. If logic and science had a soul, it would be this book. This universe Brandon Sanderson created.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the Mistborn trilogy, I always had this feeling that if it weren\u2019t a fantasy story, it could still work perfectly in the real world. There was something behind it, something that felt true. And now I understand why. Sanderson didn\u2019t just invent a world, he observed our own from a different angle. Ruin and Preservation aren\u2019t just powers in a magic system; they\u2019re a lesson about existence itself. They are the most beautiful expression of balance, of how destruction and creation need each other, how chaos and order are two sides of the same coin.\n\nFor most of the trilogy, I was convinced the Hero of Ages would be Vin. I was so sure. I was ready for that. And when I realized it wasn\u2019t her, I felt two full seconds of absolute shock, then silence, then peace. It made sense. All of it. It was the world finding its equilibrium again. It was perfect logic. That moment\u2026 it was the kind of understanding that almost hurts because it\u2019s so right.\n\nThe character arcs are pure art. Vin, Elend, Sazed\u2026 each of them shaped by purpose. Elend\u2019s death broke me, but it was also beautiful. It had to happen. It meant something. And Vin, God she was everything.\n\nThis book feels otherworldly. It doesn\u2019t just end a story, it ends an era of thought. It fuses physics, religion, morality, and art in such perfect structure that it feels divine. As a person, being able to write something so complex and raw as this is beyond amazing.\n\nSazed\u2019s existential struggles, for instance, were fascinating to me. When everything connected in the third book, and those inner conflicts finally made sense, I felt something like awe. Like someone had just explained the equation of the universe. Sazed\u2019s search through religions, his study of belief and doubt, the way he finds truth through emptiness, its genius. It\u2019s as if Sanderson took Newton\u2019s laws and turned them into a spiritual symphony.\n\nAnd yes, there are still questions. About why Vin. About the origin of everything. About what lies beyond. But those questions are part of the brilliance. They remind you that knowledge is never complete. That even divinity has mysteries. The way Sanderson mirrors the concept of God in this story is absolutely staggering. Brutal, in the most awe-inspiring sense of the word.\n\nThe ending was exquisite. Painful, necessary, inevitable. Every sacrifice, every decision, every revelation sits exactly where it should. I wouldn\u2019t change a single thing. The Hero of Ages doesn\u2019t just conclude a trilogy, it opens a door. Now I understand why he recommends this as a starter for the Cosmere. The ending of Hero of Ages is one of the most perfect endings I\u2019ve ever read in my life.\n\nVin. Elend. Sazed. Ruin. Preservation. Every piece of it. Perfect.

Last year, I stopped at 27 books, and now I want to share my top 5 books that impressed me the most this year. Let\u2019s go.\n\n**5.\u00a0\u201cThe Five Love Languages \u200b\u200bfor a Child\u201d\u00a0by Gary Chapman**. This book explores the various types of love and their impact on our lives. It\u2019s not a manual, but it\u2019s filled with ideas that, if applied, can bring more joy to your children\u2019s lives. It\u2019s a book that made me reflect on my relationships and how to make my loved ones feel truly cherished\n\nAs with any book in this genre, I wouldn\u2019t advise treating it as an instruction manual or the Bible. However, if implemented and followed, some ideas can bring more pleasant moments to your children\u2019s lives.\n\n**4.\u00a0\u201cThe Woman Who Went to Bed for a Year\u201d\u00a0by Sue Townsend** is one of my favourite books this year and my entire life. Despite its lack of a dynamic plot or deep meaning, it's a book that I find incredibly relaxing and enjoyable. The book's atmosphere allows me to relax and go with the flow, which is a rare and precious experience in today\u2019s fast-paced world\n\nYes, in it, a woman decides to lie down, and somewhere \u215e of the entire plot, she lies in bed. Someone comes to her, and somehow, the life of her husband and children develops, and she lies. Then, lying down takes a threatening turn, and I really feel sorry for the woman. I love this book because it reminds me that sometimes you can lie down and see what can happen if you lie down and stay in that state.\n\n**3.\u00a0\u201cHow to be your therapist\u201d\u00a0by Owen O\u2019Kane**. Last year, I finished four years of therapy, and this book has greatly inspired me to do it myself. I liked some exercises; I thought about how the past can help me move into the future. I recommend it to anyone interested in self-knowledge\n\n**2.\u00a0\u201cTomorrow, Tomorrow, Tomorrow\u201d\u00a0by Gabrielle Zevin**. This book is a gem, a unique and beautiful story that I wish I could experience for the first time again. It\u2019s a book I truly love and has left a lasting impression on me\n\n**1.\u00a0\u201cChoice\u201d\u00a0by Edith Eger** is perhaps the best book I have ever read. It\u2019s a powerful memoir about the author\u2019s experiences in a concentration camp and her subsequent trials. It\u2019s a story of indomitability, strength of spirit, and the truth we confront every day. This inspiring book is a must-read, even for those who don\u2019t typically read non-fiction\n\nI was not very impressed by\u00a0**\u201cDivorce\u201d\u00a0by Moa Herngren**, but it is a personal book for those who have survived and are ready to look openly at the processes that occur in couples, so it is not for a wide audience, like me.\n\nAnd what about you guys?

Sadly, I didn\u2019t read it at that time. I wish I had, though. The book was released in 2017, and I feel that if I had read it then, I would have liked it a lot, I guess. Because other than what happens on the last page, nothing really surprised me.\n\nAs I was reading it initially, I got frustrated about this discovery that Edmund found but was not revealing what it was. He kept building up a lot of suspense at every step, but after some time, I gave up and let him reveal it whenever he wanted to. But the moment I got to know about that supercomputer, I got an understanding of what it might be. So the discovery wasn\u2019t that satisfactory for me, and to be honest, I don\u2019t think it can shake religions even if it happens now because it\u2019s just modelling. The result is driven by modelling.\n\nTill this point, I felt that the book was okay \u2014 not the best one, but interesting. As I was nearing the end, I completely forgot about the murders that were committed by the Regent, and when it was confessed at the end, that was really shocking and unexpected, to be honest \u2014 and how Winston plotted all this. I am not sure how many evil plans he might have plotted, or subplots he created to achieve this, just because Edmund asked it to have a maximum audience. It\u2019s crazy, and I love it. And the way Winston achieved it is obviously cruel, but he didn\u2019t care at all.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a very interesting read.

It's not  literature, you know.   \n\nI read her though. I read the fuck out of her and I had a blast. That one about the book agent in London, who used to be a police officer in America, and the aspiring young writers from Ireland? Oh my god- the sky-blue leather jacket that the wife of the agent's lover, who was also her boss, was wearing? The pharmacist whom one of the aspiring writers had a crush on, telling her \"we're a bit long in the tooth for this game\"- she looked like Liza Minelli. I can't remember the name of the book but it was amazing. And the other one, where the husband of the newly-married heroine died, and she was heart-broken? And then she was courted by a guy who looked like Anthony Keidis from Red Hot Chili Peppers? She had the best job in the world, remember, she was a make-up rep based in New York.

I think any other version of a FMC this situation would have escalated quickly. If she was more demure, Elffa would have ran her over. Rane definitely wouldn\u2019t have been able to protect her. Physically? yes. Mentally? No. \n\nIf she came in hot and ready to fight that would have resulted in Elffa going full horror movie. \n\nSo her slow and steady pace worked best.

She was even aware that Elffa would retaliate eventually, so it didn\u2019t come as a shock to her and she was able to place enough doubt in the minds of others, plus build Rane up enough that the two sides would collide. \n\nI like how she said it was her obsession with drama shows, in reality she is just really smart and observant. She is able to work through scenarios quickly, and determine the best route. \n\n**Rane:** The way his entire community failed him at every opportunity. Yes, his mother is a master manipulator but also no one seemed safe enough for him to confide in. \n\nWhy couldn\u2019t they see how depressed he was? And suicidal? We see him contemplate his death for several chapters. Just allowing himself to be beaten, by Green and Blue and by anyone else who chose to inflict pain. We see home drowning himself in anything he can get his hands on. \n\nWhich, he did say it\u2019s better for him to make the choice and control the dosage but also we see him in the first scene choosing to down an alcohol that could be lethal. \n\nAnd that\u2019s just a slice of what\u2019s he has been going through. \n\nIt makes me think of all the real world \u201cparty animals\u201d we dismiss and what they are actually going through. \n\nWe know most drug/alcohol abusers start off by using it to cope and then it becomes an addiction. Yet we always belittle/demean and demonize them. Rarely taking the time to figure out what led to the addiction, the homelessness\u2026 well until they die. Then it\u2019s \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they ever tell anyone?\u201d \u201cThis poor person, they just needed some help!\u201d  \n\nBut then the cycle repeats with someone else. Or really it\u2019s happening simultaneously. \n\nBut I digress. Per usual. \n\n**Monster in law-** I don\u2019t want to spend anytime on her. lol. But how did she get her hands on Green/Blues brother? \n\n**Levtiram:** I can see how the trial to adulthood could be a good thing but they have no goal system in place? \n\nYou\u2019d think they\u2019d then make the person attend different courses or something. (Unless it\u2019s a medical related reason for being denied adulthood.)\n\nAnd Yes, his mother had friends and bribed people but still no one put two and two together. \n\nHis friends need their butts whooped. How do you let your buddy fall so hard. No one thought to step in? No one thought to investigate a little bit? \n\n**Protector Embassy:** I\u2019m glad they updated their rules after this but really why didn\u2019t anyone think about making sure the humans had a way to contact the embassy. \n\nEspecially after the many attempts to capture humans. \n\nThey should have been prompted to buy a combot on Holotulle, also they need a better on-boarding database. Each planet should have an introduction guide or something. You\u2019d think it would already exist, that way Ambassadors know how to move around the planet and their society, so why not have that open for Mates that are matched cross culturally?\n\n\nPrevious Read: [Alien Jeopardy by January Bell](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceFictionRomance/s/U2NvnKzTfI)", "date_utc": 1760207736.0, "title": "Mated, Manipulated, and Matriarchal: Reviewing\u00a0Mated to the Alien Baller by Talia Rhea", "upvote_ratio": 0.59, "score": 5, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1o43553/mated_manipulated_and_matriarchal_reviewing_mated/"}, {"id": "1o35nku", "name": "t3_1o35nku", "content": "I read Stephanie Meyers' Twilight series a long time ago.

Well, I got on a quest for this fall and winter to read the books I already own, instead of buying any more news ones (except The Will of the Many's #2 out this fall, that I will be buying)  So far I have done pretty well, liking or loving every old forgotten book I own.  Until, this one.  I don't even know exactly what it is, but it bores me to death! It's Edward droning on about how fragrantly tasty Bella smells, how he hungers for her blood, how he worries for her safety. It is mostly inner dialog of Edwards thoughts, of course nothing new happens. For a time he asks questions like \"what is your favorite color? or favorite music\" It's so LOOONGGG. It has more pages than Twilight. I think rereading Twilight would have been more enjoyable. \n\nSometimes I think I should stop with a series. That it might start off as fun, and end in tedious, repetition of what was once an enjoyable story.  But the urge to finish a series is huge.. But I might have to stop this one.

This book is comfortable to me. Le Guin does world building in a way that is simple and interesting and powerful. I honestly can not be very unbiased when talking about Ursula K. Le Guin. Even before I read her books or poems, I developed a proximity admiration for her from the ways that my older brothers would speak about her works. I came into this book knowing I was going to like it.\n\nI originally started this book 1-2 years ago. I was in college and constantly on the verge of a mental breakdown, so distractions like this book got cast aside for what felt like more pressing matters. Yet, in that time a certain quote from the book rooted itself in my memory, and it is probably one of my favorite quotes . It highlighted the feelings of college for me very well.\u00a0 It says \u201cYou thought, as a boy, that a mage is one who can do anything. So I thought, once. So did we all. And the truth is that as a man's real power grows and his knowledge widens, ever the way he can follow grows narrower: until at last he chooses nothing, but does only and wholly what he must do\u2026\u201d This quote made me feel like it was okay and normal that things were already out of my control. This feeling and my general admiration made it inevitable that I would start this book again.\n\nThis book has wonderfully realized settings and imaginative story beats. The way that Le Guin describes these islands and their cultures, their diversity in thought even within their own cultures. Her worlds feel real even when fantastical. Ever since I started reading I\u2019ve always had an aversion to the overly-detailed descriptions of settings, but the way that Le Guin does it often doesn\u2019t feel like just placing down a setting. There are times the setting tells just as much plot as the main meat of the story. Though there were occasional times where I felt that it dragged on for a bit, these were short enough and the parts I wanted to get to motivated me to get through it.\n\nMy personal interpretation of the shadow, though I might not be breaking any new ground with this, is that the shadow was a manifestation of Ged\u2019s fear, anxiety, and regret. As he runs away from it, it gains power. As he faces his fear it loses power. The final moment of him accepting it into himself as a part of him was him accepting his fears and regrets as a part of his story and being. I really liked it, and it spoke to my own personal life problems.\n\nAnyway, in summary, book good. 4.5/5. Will prolly read the next one.\u00a0\n\nAlso I am sooo much stronger than you and bigger than you and cooler than you, so there\u2019s that.\u00a0\n\n", "date_utc": 1760088394.0, "title": "My thoughts on A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K.

But the hjjks and their queen also have a desire to rule this new springtime. The hjjks are intelligent, united and powerful, while the People are still tribal, ignorant and split into various warring factions.\n\nNow the People are offered a peace treaty from the hjjks. This vision of security is both seductive and beautiful, but also Inhuman. Blood will run through the earth if the tribes refuse. The people themselves will either be exterminated, or they will destroy a very ancient and wise race. If the People accept the hjjks they would survive the Winter, but only to lose their newly discover humanity forever.\n\nDespite my ever obvious blunder I loved this book!

The hack is something else, a social as well as artistic type that has existed since the beginning of capitalism, at least. Plenty of people seem to know a hack when they see one; fewer notice that any individual artist or writer worthy of the name has siblings everywhere, whose work shares certain aesthetic qualities and whose personalities are congruent with each other.\"\n\n\"6. The unstoppable confidence of the hack, which hinders their improvement, is phenomenologically indistinguishable from the confidence, the fluency, that true geniuses have. One imagines the inner lives of Bach or Balzac had certain things in common with those of the hack.\n\n7. One is tempted to say, \u201cbut not those of Beethoven or Kafka.\u201d But it does not matter whether any individual hack struggles mightily to produce their work, or is crucified daily with self-doubt. The trouble is in their taste: the standards used to evaluate the work have seemingly been calibrated incorrectly.

So, sorry if this isn\u2019t super coherent or even enjoyable to read. And also, fuck you. I can do what I want.\u00a0\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed The Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu. This is my first ever sci-fi book. I had just read The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro, and after being in that post-book stupor, I decided that I needed to read something a bit more exciting. After reading some reviews, with positive reviews saying that it is the best book they\u2019ve read and negative reviews saying that the book is misogynistic, I dived into the book and read it over the course of 2-3 weeks. Since this book is sorta a slow burn, I was skeptical at first. The first couple pages of world building felt hard to piece together, but as the story progressed and characters were developed, I was hooked.\u00a0\n\nIf I had to sum up what I liked about this book in one word I would say that the book was engaging. After the set up in the first 70 or so pages, the mysteries and theories just keep you on the hook for the rest of the book. And the pay off at the end of the book! I\u2019m so glad that I don\u2019t study physics or computer science, because I feel like science fiction was right in that perfect space where it didn\u2019t break my suspension of disbelief too often. Speaking of, the sci-fi aspects of the book feel very grounded. It doesn\u2019t get star-wars/star trek levels of sci-fi until very close to the end of the book. This makes the book even more engaging because the sci-fi feels so close to us. The setting of the earthly science in the book is basically our current level of tech except slightly more advanced.\u00a0\n\nI think that all the characters ranged from great to inoffensive. Shi Qiang, he\u2019s the goat and I love him and his asshole detective down-to-earth energy. Everyone else, they\u2019re alright.\u00a0\n\nThe story really picks up and just keeps on running. I really like how the reveal of aliens being behind all the shenaniganery isn\u2019t shown until almost 2/3rds through the book. It really does the book a disservice reading reviews because I think the alien reveal is awesome and doesn\u2019t feel at all forced. The plot thread about Ye Weinje receiving and sending messages to aliens, I think that I actually audibly gasped. I really enjoyed reading this book.\u00a0\n\nSome of the negative reviews of this book said that it felt like there were plot threads that didn\u2019t lead anywhere. I honestly felt like this book was pretty solid through and through, but I did feel like the parts related to the books namesake, The Three Body game, kind of dragged on. They felt a bit pretentious as they played the game with the names of a bunch of old philosophers/astronomers. I think it\u2019s hilarious that Wang would log on and choose \u201cCopernicus\u201d as his gamer tag. I kinda kept thinking, \u201chow is this a game? This doesn\u2019t play like a game at all.\u201d Like I know that the point is to find like minded people to indoctrinate them, but it took me out a bit. Kinda sucks that the \u201cworst\u201d parts of the book were what the book was named after.\u00a0\n\nOther negative reviews said that the book was misogynistic? If the book was, I certainly didn\u2019t pick up on it. I remember reading that it was because many of the female characters were described as \u201cslim.\u201d I\u2019m sure I\u2019m misrepresenting their arguments a bit, but I felt like that the main female characters in the book were explored with a good amount of depth.\n\n\n\nOverall, good book. It leaves you excited for the next one, which I will probably be reading next.\u00a0\n\n", "date_utc": 1759906417.0, "title": "The Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu, My feelings and takes", "upvote_ratio": 0.42, "score": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1o13fi6/the_three_body_problem_by_cixin_liu_my_feelings/"}, {"id": "1o183hz", "name": "t3_1o183hz", "content": "I'm reading **Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy** right now and I'd finding it to be challenging.

The premise taps into timeless fears of witchcraft, religious oppression and the blurred line between monster and savior, all wrapped in an eerie fairy tale atmosphere.\n\nBrom's lush and grotesque prose did a great job immersing me in the oppressive, claustrophobic world of Puritan life and showcasing the vulnerability of a woman who doesn\u2019t fit into its rigid mold. Abitha is a sympathetic and relatable protagonist and Slewfoot himself is a fascinatingly ambiguous\u00a0 presence, both terrifying and reverential. The antagonists are so well written that multiple times I had to take a pause so I could cuss out these bastard bitch characters. The moral tension between witchcraft, freedom and religious repression gives the narrative a grounded human experience which goes beyond its blood and pagan spectacle. This was the first time for me reading a book illustrated by the author, guaranteeing complete clarity in the visual translation of imagination which added a haunting richness to the myth and horror.\u00a0\n\nIt isnt flawless. The pacing drags at times, and horror fans familiar with folk tropes will see some twists coming. The tone occasionally wavers between mythic parable and straightforward horror, leaving a few uneven moments. But even at its weakest, the novel has a raw, hypnotic pull that keeps you reading. Slewfoot is best approached as a dark fable which is part witch story, part feminist revenge tale and part meditation on freedom and fear.\n\nPick it up if you enjoyed watching Robert Eggers\u2019s The Witch (2015) and are drawn to morally ambiguous folklore and lush gothic horror.

And, I must say, this book and these series in general, are some of the most impressive examples of SF mastery I\u2019ve read until now.\n\n*The Mars Trilogy* by Kim Stanley Robinson, details Humanity\u2019s successful colonization of the Red Planet and then its subsequent terraforming into a life-sustaining state over a period that spans more than a century. *Red Mars* is the only book in the trilogy I\u2019ve read until now, so I\u2019ll center on that.\n\n*Red Mars* begins in 2026, with the First Hundred colonists arriving on Mars and beginning the construction of human settlements and scientific centers, as they start exploring and studying the planet. There are various characters, with the mission being a joint US \u2013 Russian venture, so I won\u2019t get into many details about specific ones here. Over a period of almost sixty or so years, we follow the humans of Mars as they slowly create communities and form a new society, up until >!an eventual revolution that starts against the Earth governments and the transnational corporations that control Mars.!<\n\nThroughout the book, the main question posed is If Humanity should terraform Mars in order to fit its needs, or If they should leave the planet as is. These positions are represented by the \u201cGreen\u201d and \u201cRed\u201d factions of the colonists respectively, who form proto-political groups around this question. Alongside them are other movements like the anarchist-like ideas of Russian cosmonaut Arkady Bogdanov and the followers of Areophany, a new religious movement that worships Mars itself in a kind of naturalist religion.\n\nI won\u2019t lie by saying that this is a difficult book to read. KSR has the habit of heavily info-dumping in every other page, talking in great detail about the technical, biological and ecological ideas, plans and consequences that unfold in the course of the Martian colonization. I won\u2019t lie that a lot of it passed over my head, as I don\u2019t have the knowledge necessary to understand it all. So, this can impede your reading experience a little, although I must admit it is extremely interesting and impressing, and a very realistic look into the details of space colonization and terraforming. It has everything from drilling moholes on the planet\u2019s surface to release heat, to constructing a space elevator connecting Mars to Earth by the later stages of the book.\n\nI will certainly finish the Mars trilogy, since it is, some of the most realistic depictions of space colonization out there. And since this idea of Martian habitation has come to the forefront once more, I believe the books can be surprisingly up to date. I definitely recommend them to anyone that wants a more realistic, \u201chard\u201d science fiction storyline.", "date_utc": 1759612305.0, "title": "A Giant Leap for Mankind: Red Mars by Kim Stanley Robinson", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "score": 131, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ny5odt/a_giant_leap_for_mankind_red_mars_by_kim_stanley/"}, {"id": "1ny0zao", "name": "t3_1ny0zao", "content": "The 1818 text is technically my second read-through as I've read the revised 1831 text about half a year ago.

Aside from enjoying myself a great deal by the end of it all, I actively reflected upon how I enjoyed the part of Fellowship where they encountered Tom Bombadil. It was a bit silly, a bit fun, a bit weird, and I generally enjoyed the vibe of that particularly slice of the adventure.\n\nNot long thereafter, I watched the extended cut version of Fellowship for the first time, and I was disappointed to discover that Bombadil was nowhere to be found! It wasn't long after that when I learned that most seem to think this was a good choice! Turns out, few people share my affection for Bombadil, and instead think that his character's exclusion from the movie was the correct choice.\n\nI can confidently say that my personal movie-watching experience was lessened (not by much, but still) by a lack of Bombadil. I was greatly looking forward to seeing the way at least SOME of that piece of Fellowship's story was portrayed in a visual manner.\n\nNow if I'm being completely honest, the extended edition is already long enough as it is. Adding Bombadil to the mix probably would have been asking too much for the movie's runtime even on an extended cut. But that didn't stop me from being disappointed nonetheless!\n\nTo those who were glad that Bombadil was cut from the movies, did you read the books first or did you watch the movies first? Because I do wonder if I may have felt differently about Bombadil as a character in the book if I had watched the movies first instead.

It illustrates, too, the difficulty of reaching out and making those connections, especially in the aftermath of deep and abiding trauma.\n\nThe novel follows the unhappy life of a young woman, Fuyuko, who works as a proofreader. This woman is the \u201cdictionary definition of a miserable person\u201d. Fuyuko calls herself so on the occasion of seeing her own reflection during a blood drive; it is an apt if unfortunate description, and it is impossible to examine this novel without at least touching upon Kawakami\u2019s words here.\n\nFuyuko\u2019s portrayal is a frank examination of a woman stuck in place. She is good at her job, detail-oriented and conscientious, but there is at first a curious vacancy of any emotional dimension to her accomplishments as a proofreader. This vacancy gives way to the realisation that there really is nothing Fuyuko gains from her work by way of spiritual sustenance. Her approach towards proofreading is reminiscent of an automaton at work: when she at one point describes the way in which she forgets everything about a proofread title after she finishes the project, I was made to think of a computer\u2019s disk drive, wiped clean and overwritten by the next assignment, and the next.\n\nThe desire for connection, the need for love at long last allows Fuyuko to reach out to another human being. These break the stifling veil of silence that chokes the novel\u2019s protagonist and she is at long last capable of reaching out to another. Kawakami\u2019s final chapter avoids the saccharine sweetness of a\u00a0*Jane Eyre*\\-style ending but rather brings to the fore a very different relationship.\n\nIn some ways, I was reminded of Rachel Cusk\u2019s\u00a0*Outline*\u00a0trilogy while reading this: here, too, there is an elision of the narrator\u2019s identity, at least to begin with. The reader learns much more about the circumstances of Fuyuko\u2019s life beyond the external ones. What I did learn about Fuyuko stumped me: why was she only taking an evening walk across Tokyo for her birthdays? These smaller, specific details began to create a picture of who Fuyuko was, a picture that clicks into place after the reader is shown Fuyuko through her own perspective on the reflection, that textbook definition of a miserable person. Following this and a flashback chapter in the middle of the novel, Fuyuko\u2019s identity easier to understand if no more accessible.\n\nWhat I at first took for elision was in truth the chocking weight of depression. A lingering darkness that swallows Fuyuko\u2019s light.\n\nSome of the most unusual and vivid sections of the novel discuss the qualities of light. Fuyuko comes alive during those, her fascination breaking through to the dark clouds of her melancholy and depression. Whether thinking about it alone or discussing the quality of light with an interlocutor, a man she meets at a cultural centre, Fuyuko brightens up. Light, the absence and presence of it, lingers in Fuyuko\u2019s perception of the world. Kawakami plays with light with such skill; likewise, light plays with Fuyuko\u2019s keen gaze, memorably and to\u00a0*All the Lovers in the Night*\u2018s last page.\n\nKawakami\u2019s dialogue is exemplary. The conversations between Fuyuko and Hijiri Ishikawa are as masterful for what they omit as they are for what is written on the page; the two women strike a friendship that makes for an emotional core to the novel. This friendship plays out through what I like to think of the stages of knowing another person: from seeing the version of themselves they put forward to the version of themselves others perceive, and finally reaching a space where they are together known.", "date_utc": 1759528019.0, "title": "All the Lovers in the Night by Mieko Kawakami: An Intimate Yearning for Connection", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "score": 68, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1nxc6tx/all_the_lovers_in_the_night_by_mieko_kawakami_an/"}, {"id": "1nx9jny", "name": "t3_1nx9jny", "content": "", "date_utc": 1759521663.0, "title": "Ukrainian publisher of Gabor Mat\u00e9, Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez, and Michel Odent hit by Russian drone strike", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "score": 52, "url": "https://chytomo.com/en/ukrainian-publisher-of-gabor-mate-carlos-gonzalez-and-michel-odent-hit-by-russian-drone-strike/"}, {"id": "1nxebnj", "name": "t3_1nxebnj", "content": "A \"fable\" by the celebrated Florinese author. My very first copy of this gem was acquired over 40 years ago when I was browsing the shelves of the local bookstore and browsed past \"S. Morgenstern\", did a double-take, and came back.\n\nSure enough, it was a newly released story by the great Florinese master. I was ecstatic! I immediately purchased it and scurried home where I devoured it in a single session. Sadly, my first edition was misplaced during a move and when I went to purchase a copy of the then-current paperback edition, the author had, through some gross negligence, been listed as a certain \"William Goldman\". The confusion appears to have stemmed from this \"Goldman\" having once published an abridgement of the master's best known work, \\_The Princess Bride\\_. (I won't address the travesty of attempting to abridge a seminal Florinese work of literature.) I was devastated, but I needed to replace my book so I grudgingly purchased it despite it being a principle example of the folly of American literary capitalism.\n\nFast forward to \"near now\" and I once again had a hankering to read this story and once again my copy had been lost along the way. This time, however, I consulted Amazon and was rewarded with several available used copies of the first edition of \\_The Silent Gondoliers\\_, in hardcover, with the proper authorial attribution. Needless to say, I chose one and through the magic of Priority Mail, I soon had a copy in my hands and I once again devoured it all in a single session.\n\n\\_The Silent Gondoliers\\_  is, like much of Morgenstern's work, a layered experience.  After admonishing his publishers that \"I am old, but I am alive. Perhaps as you age will find the two are not mutually exclusive.\", Morgenstern begins his book with a memory of being a child in Venice on Christmas and hearing the beautiful singing of the gondoliers. Yet, nowadays, the gondoliers are silent and only a few old people now remember what it was like to hear them as they ferried their customers around the canals of Venice.\n\nThis  is the outer layer, if you will. The mystery - what silenced them? Why? Morgenstern began an investigation that, being Florinese with some Italian heritage as well, he felt uniquely qualified to conduct. He details the pursuit of this mystery with anecdotes about the insular life of gondoliers and the many colorful ways that they are like yet specially unlike other society. One particular anecdote involving a British couple who attempt to find refreshment at the gondolier's tavern (note: not \"a\" tavern, \"the\" tavern) will have the reader wishing to have been there to witness it themselves.\n\nMorgenstern's investigations lead him to the story of Luigi, the protagonist of the story that explains the mystery that Morgenstern uncovered and eventually unravels. This is the inner layer. The full story is short - only 110 pages and those are seldom full of text and many contain no text at all; rather the wonderful illustrations of Paul Giovanopoulos. Given the brevity of the story and, as I have intimated, the fact that it can be consumed in an afternoon or less, I am loathe to give much in the way of plot summary except to say this - It is a story of the perseverance of human spirit and  finding treasure and opportunity in the midst of disaster and destruction, and the aftermath of that epiphany. In a sense it is a Christmas miracle, but only really in the sense that the climax happens to occur on Christmas - it is \"on\" Christmas, not \"about\" Christmas, if you take my meaning.\n\nAs you might conclude from my own admission of having purchased this book three separate times, twice being the exact same first edition, I personally enjoyed this story immensely and found it both entertaining and thought-provoking. This in no way is \\_The Princess Bride\\_, yet if you enjoyed reading that book (and even if you only ever watched the film) I believe you will find your time spent reading \\_The Silent Gondoliers\\_ to be time well spent.\n\n(edited to correct the initial purchase date - sheesh, where has time gone?)", "date_utc": 1759533469.0, "title": "The Silent Gondoliers by S.

Kuang is also a recent favourite of mine, so hearing she was set to release a book that was a love letter to Dante\u2019s Inferno made it my most anticipated read of the year. I had been taking notes throughout my reading on how it compared and contrasted to The Divine Comedy, and thought I'd share my notes/thoughts, for anyone else who might want to enhance their reading experience in the same way. \n\n# Broad context of either work \n\nThe Divine Comedy is a piece of Italian Epic Poetry written around 1308-1321 by Dante Alighieri. It was a poem of 100 stanzas, or \"cantos\". He wrote it in exile from Florence, as a way to ingratiate himself back into Florentine society, by creating a work so grand that Florence would want to claim it (and Dante as its author) as a symbol of Florence\u2019s cultivated culture. Dante however had a tumultuous relationship with Florence, formerly being a pretty high member in Florentine society, yet overseeing in-fighting and civil wars before his exile. It's clear he still loved Florence and still wanted to be part of its cultural legacy, despite how much he hated the fractious nature of Florentine society, and this turbulent relationship he transferred into his writings. \n\nOn the other hand, Katabasis is the most recent novel by American writer Rebecca F Kuang. Born in China, raised in Texas, before undertaking higher education through Cambridge and Oxford (and currently undertaking a PhD program through Yale) Kuang is known for writing many works of fantasy, recently including some works in the Dark Academia sub-genre. While it's clear that Kuang loves education, the pursuit of knowledge, her experiences at each institution, and what she's learned, it's also clear that she has many criticisms with the structure of such educational institutions, for the many systemic and prejudiced failings of institutes such as them, for the dark history that exists behind either institute as an institute of power, to the small scale abuses of power that can be committed by some within through even the small amounts of power they wield. She too thus transferred thus turbulent relationship into her writing, hence turning to the dark Academia genre. \n\nThis may be surface level, but I already think this is an interesting link. Two authors writing works that they are both immensely knowledgeable and passionate about, yet still harbor some conflicting feelings within themselves about their passions. And I know some people say Kuang is very didactic in her themes or politics, which is a part of her writing which never really bothered me because, well Dante was also very didactic. And I personally think if the matter's important to either, of course they're going to make it clear in their writing.  \n\n# Overview of either work \n\nBoth works deal with a passage through the underworld. Inferno (is really only one part of The Divine Comedy) tells the journey of Dante (or a fictional representation of himself), lost in the wild (presumably following his real-life exile), finding a savior in the form of one of his literary inspirations, Virgil, who guides him through Hell, so that he can reach the other side, and tell the world of what he saw there, as evidence of God's divine abilities. It's only part of The Comedy though, where he then also climbs up Mount Purgatory, taking a similar look at sinners and their penitence there, before reaching the peak, being cleansed of his sins, reuniting with his love Beatrice before taking a journey through Paradise. It is important to note that while Dante wrote himself as the main character of his work, he populated the underworld with many real (if often historical) figures. He knew however that the work he was writing was fictional, or allegorical, so this was not him preaching some prophetic vision. We know this, because some of his other works were likewise allegorical, e.g. Convivio, or The Feast, where he described literary or ethical debate as being like a banquet or feast, where everyone brings something to the table, everyone is nourished by the act and goes away richer than they arrived. \n\nKatabasis tells the story of the fictional character Alice Law, an American grad student studying in Cambridge, undertaking a PhD in analytical magic, with her fellow grad student Peter Murdock, only to have her PhD supervisor killed in a magical accident. The two decide to use their magic to journey to the underworld and bring their advisor back, so that they can graduate. Unlike Dante, her characters are all fictional, both in terms of the leads, and the characters that inhabit the Hell she depicts. Now, many have pointed the clear biographical links between Kuang and her main character, Alice (not like Dante didn't write himself into his own works, too), and of their romantic counterparts, but we can see while both works deal with themes of the underworld, the character motivations are different: Dante was merely lost, it was Virgil (acting at the behest of higher powers) that took Dante through Hell, Purgatory and Heaven, whereas Alice had explicit purpose and intention to travel the underworld.  \n\nYet aside from the intentions of the characters to contend with, there's also the intention of the creators. It can be interpreted that Dante's goal, as well as ingratiating himself back into Florentine society, or demonstrating God's divinity, was hoping to illuminate the forces within men that drive them apart (I'll comment on that further in this analysis). Meanwhile, Kuang, as well as wanting to expose some of the darker corners of the academic world and writing a love letter to works like Dante's Inferno, wanted to express her more complicated feelings of love for academia itself. Katabasis is billed as a love story in Hell, and while Alice and Peter's relationship do follow some tropes in the romance genre, I'd say it's Alice's (or really Kuang's) complicated love of academia that really drives the book. \n\nHowever, why I really wanted to talk about these books, is because both deal with the nature, or the structure of Hell. Most of this remaining post will just be a closer comparison with or inspection of the underworld that either author have created, as I've always been fascinated with works that deal with the underworld, especially when they want to put a new spin on it. This analysis can be quite deep and long, as it really is a niche interest of mine, hence my structuring this post into deeper and deeper dissections of either work. Feel free only to engage with the depth that captures your attention. \n\n# Broad Structure and Purpose of Hell \n\nDante is known for designing a structure of Hell based around Nine circles, arranged in a hierarchy. The uppermost circles, closest to the surface world, punish lesser sins, with lesser punishments, yet the more egregious the sin is, the lower down it is placed, and the worse the punishment. On the other hand, Kuang devises a Hell based around Eight Courts, with the physical layout being ambiguous. Some characters see it as hierarchical like Dante, some see the dimensions as instead being parallel to each other. Neither is really \"closer\" or \"further away\" though from the surface world though, as it exists in a kind of four-dimensional space, out of and away from the material world.  \n\nAs well as the structure however, there is also the spiritual purpose of either Hell. Dante's Hell was strictly a Catholic view of Hell. It housed some Deities from other belief systems (e.g. King Minos, Charon, Cerberus, Plutus, Phlegyas) but only really for being part of pagan belief systems not compatible with Christianity's monotheistic view of God (while still allowing Dante to acknowledge inspiration from some of his pre-Christian Greek and Italian forefathers, like Virgil). His view of Hell was for people who had intentionally or unintentionally moved away from God to be punished until Judgement day, whereupon their body would reunite with their soul and multiply their suffering further. He did allow some option for redemption for sinners through Mount Purgatory, for sinners who did believe and wanted to make right with God, so long as they could purge themselves of their sins, they could eventually end up in Paradise. In that way, Dante's works were instructive of how to live a virtuous life (or avoid a sinful existence) for those reading it back in the mortal world. But some of the many \"ironic punishments\" he devised in his construction of Hell/Purgatory (as well as being borrowed from some pre-Christian Greek and Italian classics) were supposed to be symbols of Gods divinity, as only a being as divine as God could create something so complex yet symmetrical as the Hell he described (which was ironic, given that he knew he was writing a fiction, hence this was his detailed vision, not God's). \n\nMeanwhile in Kuang's underworld, there are a mix of world religions at play here, while obviously taking some notes from Dante's Christian designs, there's also some classic Italian and Greek influences, like Orpheus's journey through Hades realm, Aeneas' journey through Tartarus, some mentions of some Mesopotamian or Egyptian under world beliefs, but on the whole is largely influenced by Chinese mythology, such as Lord Yama being the Lord of the Dead in this book and offering a type of karmic reincarnation. In Katabasis, souls aren't necessarily doomed to eternal punishment; the Courts system offers a series of trials that, if one can pass, they are granted reincarnation through Lord Yama. This does make the idea of a hierarchical hell a bit questionable then, as any soul would necessarily flow through all the courts before seeking reincarnation rather than being fixed in one place like in Dante\u2019s depiction of Hell, but I'm still going to describe the souls in this book as if they are \"fixed\" in an hierarchical hell, for ease of communication. But, the idea of souls progressing through a series of tests before being cleansed/reborn/reincarnated via the river Lethe is if anything more akin to Dante's depiction of Mount Purgatory than it is of his Hell. \n\n# The environments of Hell \n\nLooking at a more detailed look: Between Dante's Circles and Kuang's Courts, some share themes, and yet others diverge. In the broadest overview, to Dante, the circles/landmarks were organised as such:  \n\n- the Gates of Hell \n\n- the Antechamber (for souls awaiting Judgement; as they line up and trudge through mud, they are bitten by bugs and stinging insects, reminding them viscerally of God's presence, that they believed they could ignore in life) \n\n- the river Archeron (crossed with Charon) \n\n- Circle 1: Limbo (for the Virtuous Unbaptized, a dimly lit plain only illuminated by occasional plumes of fire, reminding the inhabitants of the dimness they experience in a life without God) \n\n- Circle 2: Lust (where souls are blown about by cyclones, just as their lives were swept up in the tempestuous nature of Lust) \n\n- Circle 3: Gluttony (souls are weighed down by their heavy bodies and fixed in place, hammered by pounding rain, and fed on by the Cerberus) \n\n- Circle 4: Greed (souls are tasked with pushing immense boulders back and forth, representing the wealth of possessions they hoarded in life) \n\n- Circle 5: Wrath and Sloth (wrathful souls thrash around endlessly in the muddy/boggy banks of the Styx, or slothfully drown to its waters) \n\n- the river Styx (crossed with Phlegyas) \n\n- The City Dis (where Hell stops representing a natural environment, and starts resembling a city, housing Medusa and her Gorgon sisters) \n\n- Circle 6: Heresy (souls are trapped within high-walled sepulchers as they burn eternally) \n\n- Circle 7: Violence (sub-circles: violence against others, where souls are chased by Centaurs and Minotaurs through the molten waters of the river Phlegathon, violence against self, where souls are turned into trees in the suicide forest, and fed on by Harpies, or violence against God, where souls March eternally through a barren desert with raining fires and embers) \n\n- Circle 8: Deception (sub-pockets: seducers, flatterers, simonacs, soothsayers, corrupt businessmen, hypocrites, thieves, usurpers, schismists and falsifiers). Almost too many to describe: seducers are whipped by horny demons, flatterers wade through deep pits of shit, simonacs are buried head down with their feet lit on fire, soothsayers are forced to walk backwards with their heads turned unnaturally around, corrupt businessmen are thrown into boiling pitch (by more horny demons), hypocrites are forced to march wearing heavy, lead vests, thieves are chased by snakes and reptiles, yet hideously fuse bodies when caught, usurpers are turned into disembodied flames, schismists are ripped in half from chin to anus, and falsifiers are cursed to endure Leprosy \n\n- and Circle 9: Treason, which houses the Devil (all souls are trapped frozen in ice to their neck) \n\nYou'll note that the earlier sins (lust, gluttony, greed, wrath and sloth) are based on a lack of proper control over one's appetites and desires, which Dante termed the \u201csins of incontinence\u201d. They are punished in or by rather natural looking environments (muddy rivers, bug bites, cyclonic winds, rain, boulders, etc). The latter sins however are ones of intention (Heresy, Violence, Deception, Treason) and are housed in more structured environments (the walled city of Dis, the concentric rings of Violence, the many pockets of Deception, another walled City in Treason). This is in part Dante's comment on the nature of the former sins being driven by natural desires not being properly curtailed, while the latter sins come from an intention of act, purpose or design (just like the natural vs structured environment). Yet another interpretation is that the wild environments of the upper Hell are a reflection of Dante being lost in the wild at the start of his journey (being exiled), yet as he journeys deeper, he enters environments more reminiscent of the walled city of Florence, indicating the moral failures of that city were perhaps born of these deeper sins, and with such he is brought closer and closer to his own Hell throughout his journey, being the failed state of Florence. In fact, part of Dante's motive was to depict the forces in men which turn them against each other or themselves (as I alluded to above), why, as well as the classic Christian demons, his Hell houses many half-man, half-beast creatures (Medusa and the Gorgons, Centaurs, Minotaurs, Harpies, etc.), symbolically representative of the forces that prey upon man turning against themselves. I should also note that each of these observations are ones I gained from the annotations and essays provided by the Robin Kirkpatrick translation of The Divine Comedy. \n\nMeanwhile, Kuang's Hell is organised as follows:  \n\n- Asphodel (souls awaiting judgement, a barren plain where souls line up to enter the Gates of Hell, a large wall made of bone) \n\n- Court One: Pride (an infinitely spanning university Library, where souls are charged with writing an essay to \"Define the Good\") \n\n- Court Two: Desire (an infinitely spanning student centre, where souls imbibe from a fountain, which disinhibits them enough to act out their carnal desires in one of the many dorms throughout the centre) \n\n- Court Three: Greed (with the bridge of sighs, where souls become stones or tiles as part of the bridge's construction, for a sentence of certain years; which later leads into the desert of Greed, where souls fight back and forth with primitive weapons over the same stretches of sand). It also houses one of the scattered deities in this underworld, being The Weaver Girl, who offers a Prisoner's Dilemma type bargain to sojourners in this region. \n\n- Court Four: Wrath (a bog with the writhing souls of the undead contained below its surface) \n\n- Court Five: Violence (a mountainous region, with scattered geometric boulders and \"Escher traps\" which are used by the Kripke's, antagonists throughout the book, to capture their victims with) \n\n- Court Six: Cruelty (a barren desert with scattered, abstract geometric objects, and souls undergoing self-imprisonment in cages of bone) \n\n- Court Seven: Tyranny (A campus-like Clock tower, where souls are again encased within the brickwork) which also houses the Erinyes, deities which can see directly into your soul, study your worst sins, and grant or refuse entry into the last court \n\n- Finally, there is the Eighth Court (Oathbreakers, for people who have gone against their promised words to others, who once again are tasked with writing a life's essay or dissertation, pleading for their own reincarnation) \n\n- Within this Court is the City of Dis (an elaborate walled city, more reminiscent of a highly architectured church or the Sistine Chapel, which the souls have made in defiance of their imprisonment in Hell). It also houses many further deities such as Nessus and Laplace's Demon \n\n- All are bordered by the river Lethe, whose waters cleanses you of all memory, with finally Lord Yama's throne sitting outside this entire structure. Passage to Yama\u2019s throne is only granted once shades have rectified themselves of all past sins. \n\nAt first you'll notice that Kuang's Hell is structured as a university or college Campus. Just as Dante constructed a Hell that was familiar of his life (the architecture/city of Florence), so too does Kuang create an environment similar to her own (the world of academia). This is something that many other writers have displayed before e.g. William Blake in his poem The Marriage of Heaven and Hell made a design of Hell that was similar to a printing press or publishing house, which was notable as he self-published and printed his own pamphlets and poetry, so such an environment was intimately familiar to him. Furthermore, Steven L Peck, himself a doctorate level academic, also designed a Hell that took the form of an Infinite Spanning Library (modelled after Borges' The Library of Babel) in his novella A Short Stay in Hell. Kuang at least offers an in-universe reason for this, and why so many depictions of the underworld look like the life of the author describing their hell: that death can be a disorientating experience, so the afterworld has something of a plastic nature to it which constructs itself around the inhabitants\u2019 own perceptions (more on that in the comments).  \n\nBut further than that, just as Dante's Hell went from wild to civilised or architectured environments, you can see Kuang's Hell goes from structured (the Library, the student centre, the Bridge), to wild and natural environments (the deserts of Greed, the bog, the mountains, the barren lands of cruelty) before returning to highly architectured environments (the clock tower and the City of Dis). As the character Elspeth puts it, this represents the \"degeneration of the psyche\". This journey from familiar to wild and back follows the Alice\u2019s character arc, from feeling sure of what she knew of herself, her relationships, her life, and what her mission was in Hell from the start of the story, before being exposed to several revelations that slowly tear away at her pre-conceived views of what she thought she knew of the world and those around her, before a large character revelation in Court Five, Violence, where the character starts building their identity and perceptions back up again into a new direction, just as they return to more architectured environments again. \n\nAnother point of comparison, the river Lethe is found at the peak of Mount Purgatory in Dante's text, not in Hell, as Kuang describes it. Though in both it cleanses you of your past life/sins/memory and acts as a kind of Baptismal imagery. Therefore, Kuang's Hell takes on elements equally from Inferno and Mount Purgatory. \n\n# A closer comparison between the texts \n\nThe first environment of Dante's Hell is the Antechamber, a vestibule (not a circle in itself) where souls await Judgement by King Minos to be placed into their respective circle of Hell. Dante and Virgil here are escorted by Charon across the river Acheron (not Styx, which has its place later). The first proper circle of Hell is Limbo, a dim plain illuminated only by occasional plumes of fire, housing the souls of the \"virtuous unbaptized\", people who lead virtuous lives but for reasons often out of their control were never baptized or introduced to Christian society, beliefs and practices, (i.e. Dante knows his inspiration, Virgil, would be branded as a Pagan by his Christian beliefs, but in creating Limbo as the least punishing circle of Hell, he basically creates an environment of Hell exempt from the usual suffering of Hell for figures such as Virgil that he respects).  \n\nKuang's first environment is similarly a dim plain, but composed of sandy dunes of ash, illuminated only by a low lying, red son. Souls likewise mill around here as they await to be processed. This is termed the Viewing Pavilion, where souls can just barely interact with an inverted version of the material plane. Kuang explicitly relates this environment to that of the Antechamber/Limbo of Dante's Hell, intentionally engaging with that text. Kuang also points out that this pavilion, like the Antechamber, is not a proper Court/Circle of Hell, only a temporary holding space. (Note: Kuang doesn't have a court similar to Dante's first circle, as her underworld is intentionally polytheistic, and so she does not condemn \u201cpagans\u201d). \n\nThe first Court of Kuang's Hell however is Superbia, the Court of Pride. Dante did not have a circle dedicated to Pride in his version of Hell, but in Mount Purgatory, it was the lowest terrace, the least egregious sin and the easiest to purge. Dante believed that Pride wasn't wrong to feel, so long as you felt it as the pride in your works, and that your works were directed towards deepening your understanding of or honouring God, e.g. his own craft of the Divine Comedy, a poem of 100 Cantos, could be regarded with pride without sin (according to Dante), as it was in service to God. In Purgatory, souls dwelling in this terrace carry boulders across marble floors (thus labouring towards a certain craft, like stone masonry), in a room designed with detailed stone-masonry carvings of religious significance, such that the inhabitants here may also learn to create great works of art honouring God. To Dante, the environment (of Mount Purgatory at least) directs the individual inside that environment into achieving an elevated morality. \n\nIn Kuang's Superbia, this court is described as a library, with marble floors, wooden bookshelves, stained glass windows with religious imagery, evoking an environment like the first Terrace of Mount Purgatory. This library is said to be so elaborate as the better the library is, the better work you can do inside of it. Once again, the environment is directing the inhabitants towards moral development, through industrious work they take pride in. The inhabitants here are tasked with/commanded to \"Define the Good\" in essays that they write, again their environment here quite literally directs them in a task that may elevate their morals or purge them from the sin of Pride. \n\nYet, a unique challenge appears in Kuang's First Court, in the form of the character George Edward Moore. One important difference between Katabasis and The Divine Comedy are the two leads, and their relationships to each other. In Inferno, Dante inserts himself as the lead character and inserts Virgil (a poet some century/millennia his senior, whose works likewise elevated Italian history and culture) as a guide. Virgil has a paternal attitude towards Dante in The Divine Comedy, always protecting him, leading him, and he is depicted as morally resolute by Dante. Alice and Peter are the two leads of Katabasis, but they are peers, of virtually equal footing, neither can truly guide the other as Virgil does Dante (not to mention the questionable morals of either). So when the two leads from Katabasis arrive in the first Court, they meet Moore, who offers to lead them, yet more accurately, he misleads them. (Other guides will be discussed below). \n\nMoore ignores the direction to \u201cDefine the Good\u201d. He pridefully scorns and gossips over the other inhabitants and chooses to appoint himself as the \"Dean of the Library\". Moore quite clearly is not a suitable moral guide on the purging of prideful behaviours. Alice and Peter cannot be guided out of Pride by someone who knows no way out and has no intention of leaving or bettering himself. Furthermore, Moore constantly tries to flatter Peter, and play to his sense of Pride, trying to appeal to him as both of their being \"Cambridge men\", playing to their elitism and male chauvinism. It's only Alice learning to intentionally break away from her (socially learned) prideful behaviours (where she recalls a similar incident where she bought into institutional pride and snobbery, which was quashed at Professor Grimes' command) that they can exit the library and move past this court. \n\nThe second Court in Katabasis is Desire, a complex amalgam of both lustful and gluttonous appetites. This thus shares themes in common with both the second and third circles in Dante's Inferno, Lust which features cyclones blowing lovers together and apart, and Gluttony, which punishes shades with immobilising rains, and predation by Cerebus. The journey to the Court of Desire in Katabasis is marked by certain obstacles: first, bone creators, that Peter mistakes for the Cerberus (note: the bone creatures are not limited to this court however, making an increasing appearance throughout the book. As well, Cerberus would make his appearance proper later in Katabasis, in the City of Dis), and next, an eternally raging storm (though this rain does not immobilise anyone, unlike in Dante's Inferno, yet there are strong winds that blow you towards the Court itself, to hamper your exit, thus again similar to both of Dante\u2019s circles of Lust and Gluttony).  \n\nOnce inside the student center of Desire, Alice is immediately repulsed, both by the dilapidation of the building, and the single-minded acting out of carnal desires by the inhabitants. Alice and Peter relate that the meagre living of a Cambridge grad student affords them an appreciation for an ascetic lifestyle, making them impervious to the wants and temptations of Desire. Alice internally recalls another moment of her late Professor Grimes asking her of her desires, only for her unable to offer up a suitable suggestion (at least in this moment of time), which again buffers her of the sin of desire. But, from this point on, the main characters are not really purged of their sins in life, as they are not dead, and unlike Dante they aren't tasked with bringing the word of God's enlightenment to Earth. \n\nThe next court is that of Greed (circle four to Dante). To Dante, Greed was one of the \"sins of incontinence\", i.e. a sin due to the lack of restraint in human drives. To Dante, these were sins that only really affect the sinning individual, not other people. Kuang intentionally contrasts this viewpoint in her depiction of Greed. To Kuang, greed can absolutely be an intentional sin, rather than one of incontinence, and as well can harm other people, not just the sinner itself. This is represented in three examples: the story of Bill Cadeaux, whose greed led them to intentionally sabotage their colleague Hollis Galloway. It is also represented with the Cooke scholarship, which only Peter or Alice could win, not both, where one's triumph means another defeat. This is furthermore demonstrated again in the Prisoner's Dilemma contest that the Weaver Girl has both Peter and Alice play, where one person's greed can absolutely lead to the other's detriment. In terms of the tests that Kuang's Hell requires, this is one test that her main characters failed. The environment of the Third Court is as well an architectured environment (the Bridge of Sighs, in contrast with the natural environments of Dante), which could also therefore imply greed as an intentional act, which shows Kuang not just inheriting but consciously engaging in the view of the underworld, as well as the discussion of moral ethics underpinning such representations, as suggested by Dante. \n\nBefore reaching the next Court, Peter and Alice meet Espeth, a Cambridge colleague preceding their scholarship, and a suicide death (as well as a partial guide to the pair. Just as Virgil was a predecessor and teacher to Dante, so too is Elspeth here, both in terms of their academics in life, and in the knowledge of the underworld they possess in death). The autonomy and freedom Espeth is afforded in Hell presents an interesting contrast to Dante's Hell. In The Inferno, Dante depicts suicide deaths as belonging to circle 7, where these shades are transformed into trees and fixed in place as part of the \"Suicide Forest\". Thus Elspeth journeying through all eight Courts of Hell and beyond marks another intentional deviation from the viewpoint of Dante. While Violence exists as a Court of Hell in Kuang's story, Elspeth doesn't have any particular ties there. \n\nMoving on though, following Greed to Dante is a circle that encompasses both sins of Wrath and Sloth. The wrathful souls thrash endlessly in the bogs of the River Styx, meanwhile the slothful souls mournfully rest at the bottom of the river. Dante and Virgil meet Phlegyas here, who ferries them to the City of Dis and Circle 6, Heresy (note: Kuang states Dante posits Dis as within the final circle of Hell. While there is a city wall in his final circle,  Treason, and it could be argued that Dis encompasses all environments from circles 6 through to 9, it still could be remarked that Dis first appears at the circle for Heresy, and that worse sins remain to be punished below). Kuang nonetheless alludes to some of these concepts from Dante's fifth circle as Peter and Alice sail upon Elspeth's Neurath. First, the two looking into the Lethe's watery depths see images of faces, lives and people in the water, which turn out to be memories from mortals up above. This reminds Alice of the slothful souls in the Styx. Not only that, but the far reaches of Greed are a dessert of endless fighting, just like Dante's wrathful souls. Phlegyas as well exists as a deity within this court, just as he was a ferryman at this point in the Inferno (though his description is quite different to his depiction within the Inferno). But in Kuang's actual Court of Wrath, the bog itself serves as another allusion to Dante\u2019s text, depicted here as a bog with shades residing below its depths (just like the slothful shades of the Styx), that  writhe, claw at and attack passersby (just like the wrathful shades of Styx), which thus makes it probably the closest in its depiction to one of Dante's environments of Hell. \n\nSaving a discussion of Dis for later, Dante's seventh circle is Violence, subdivided into three concentric circles: those who committed violence against others, those who committed violence against themselves, and those who committed violence against God. For Kuang, the three Courts of Violence, Cruelty and Tyranny could be considered similar to Dante's 7th Circle in being three courts/circles sharing the common theme of violence, differing by shades of intensity or intention. It is observed by Alice in the text that cruelty really could be considered an extension of violence by intensity or intentionality, as is tyranny to cruelty. This is seen metaphorically as well, as there is very little geographically dividing the courts of Violence, Cruelty and Tyranny, being one long, continuous, barren wasteland. As a small note, this is the only Court where no shades are encountered (implied to be victims of the Kripke's hunting, itself an obvious act of violence).  \n\nTyranny returns Alice to campus-like environments, featuring a clock tower whose stonework is composed of encased shades (just like the shades making up the earlier Bridge of Sighs). The tower is guarded by three Erinyes, who admit only the most wicked souls to the Eight Court, and the City of Dis. (As an aside: this piece of world building, just like the sentencing terms required of shades composing the Bridge of Sighs complicates a comparison of Kuang\u2019s underworld with Dante\u2019s depictions of either Hell or Purgatory. In the Inferno, souls are fixed in their location in Hell. They are not there to learn a lesson, as their punishment is eternal. The lesson is really there to be learned by the reader, hence Dante bringing back word of the divinity of God back to the living world. In Mount Purgatory, shades do progress through all terraces, gradually purging themselves of sins, before acceptance into Paradiso. Kuang\u2019s underworld is a blend of either of Dante\u2019s underworlds, yet here is where we can see a conflict emerge between the two models. If shades in Kuang\u2019s underworld are to progress through each Court to complete their transcript before reincarnation, then why would the Erinyes only admit the worst sinners? Wouldn\u2019t they be required to admit all sinners? Furthermore, if sinners are to show a learning process, or purging of sin, then why are souls in the Bridge of Sighs given a sentencing length rather than a moral task? e.g. one soul says he was required to be present for 3 years before progressing. So, are souls really learning/purging themselves of sin, or just passing arbitrary terms of confinement? It really is only a minor complaint and doesn\u2019t really hurt the overall product of the book, but I thought I\u2019d mention it as part of my comparison here). \n\nBeyond the Circle of Violence for Dante however is the Circle of Deception (for abusing the trust in strangers/people who had no reason to trust in you) then the final Circle, representing Treason (betraying the trust of those who had reason to trust in you, e.g. community, country, family, and God). Being a hierarchical Hell, this houses the worst sinners in the afterlife, including Lucifer himself. Kuang's Eighth Court likewise hosts the worst shades, those who break oaths to others, analogous to Dante's Circles of Deception and Treason. This desert is littered with torn pages of handwriting, as souls are tasked with writing dissertations on their life and making a moral case for reincarnation (just like the essays in Court One). Yet, the shades in this court, as is their deceitful nature, deny or rationalise their sins, and demand their immediate reincarnation or release from Hell in spite of any moral development on their own part. Not only does the task of essay writing echo the task given in Court One, but so too does the errant guide in the form of John Gradus, someone who likewise has no intentions of righting themselves of their sin or following along with the task of essay writing. (Jumping ahead however, again Kuang\u2019s worldbuilding can be critiqued here, as >!Gradus is offered reincarnation simply from helping Alice to defeat the Kripke's (thus keeping an Oath he made her), rather than writing the essay he was actually charged with. He still shows moral development, purging himself of prior sins, but the nature, structure and purpose of Kuang's hell is confusing given this relevation, as this example is at odds with the assigned task of that court!<). \n\nAt the center of the Eighth Court is the City of Dis, beautifully architectured and reminiscent of The Vatican or the Sistine Chapel. The shades here have constructed their own immaculate city in defiance of their own hellish environment, reminiscent of John Milton's Paradise Lost: \"The mind is its own place, and in itself/Can make a heav'n of hell, a hell of heav'n\". We see a similar sentiment echoed in Kuang's writing, \"Damn us, and we will make Hell shine\". Again, we see how the perception of Hell changes the nature of Hell itself, as the shades, dismissive of the reality of their sins and their environment, have constructed something so holy and grand, and so out of place to their current reality. \n\nInside Dis are many rooms or sub-environments. This is similar to the multi-pocketed architecture of The Malbolge in Dante's Circle 8, except the Malbolge were putrid and hostile, in contrast to the immaculate beauty and order of Dis in Kuang's text. These room are: \n\nFirst a huddle of academics watching one submit a potential dissertation. The acceptance/rejection process is similar to the process depicted by Steven L Peck in A Short Stay in Hell, where souls are likewise tasked with finding one book describing their life which once submitted will allow transfer to heaven. The very act of the \"dissertation\" process is just an academic aesthetic layered on top of the Christian practice of confession, that one\u2019s life can be atoned for, and salvation secured, so long as one confesses their sins, up to the moment of death. \n\nThe next room is a writer's bazaar, with peddlers offering resources, services or short cuts in preparing your dissertation, where it is said the over-crowded and attention demanding nature of the Bazaar acts as an intentional distraction from your duty to deliver your dissertation/truth. In that way, it is similar to Buddhist principles of Viksepa, anything that would distract you from your journey to discover the true nature of reality, and thus act as a barrier to enlightenment. \n\nThe third room is the Workshop, where academics work to review each other's confessions, or debate the metaphysics of Hell, the afterlife, reincarnation or eternal damnation. Professor Gertrude, a soul residing here, even channels Milton's Paradise Lost, Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, or Nietzsche to argue against the desire to confess one\u2019s sins and rebirth. She heads the Rebel Citadel, souls who refuse their own call towards reincarnation. She also acts as another false-guide to Alice, just as Moore and Gradus had been before. \n\nGertrude takes Alice to a winding garden path, bordered by hedges, yet as it turns out, these hedges are the transformed bodies of the Rebels, so opposed to the idea of moral progression that they have fixed themselves in place. While the imagery can seem similar to the Suicide Forest as described by Dante, I'd say it is more familiar to the imagery of William Blake's poetry. Specifically, it is reminiscent of Orc/Satan, becoming a tree in Hell, in defiance of Urizen, in Blake\u2019s prophetic work Vala: The Four Zoas. Orc was himself a very Miltonian figure, based around the Lucifer from Paradise Lost, so it is well fitting with the motivation of the Rebel Citadel.  \n\nThus, from all of this, we can see the entire environment of Dis is one great fraud to the many fraudsters inside. Alice is so distraught by this information that she flees Dis entirely. In the wild barrens of Court Eight, she finds and fights a tiger, which reinvigorates her, redirects her and sets her on a new course of action for the final stretch of the book. Following her fighting the Kripke\u2019s and being exposed to the Lethe, Alice's tattoo (which had magically and permanently fixed her memories) is washed away in the River Lethe.

The book states that Philip shrugs his shoulders and says, \"A conjuring trick, my dear- a very good one...\".\n\n....\n\nPhilip doesn't deny killing Blore with the marble bear (!!) Making it seem to Vera (AND THE READER - or at least, to me) that Philip was the killer the whole time and had somehow accomplished all of those murders on his own, and is a master of creating traps and misdirection from his experiences out on \"the field\". And was paid to do these murders, cause he was on a job, which the reader was basically told at the beginning of the book.\n\nBUT apparently Justice Wargrave committed ALL of the murders?? And Philip had nothing to do with ANY of them??? And Philip didn't care to wonder about the true murderer or how they were done, NOR who the \\*eff JUST killed Blore when they thought it was just those two left on the island in that final moment with Vera? Or he thought that Vera did all of those (or some of) the murders??? (Which I don't think he did).\n\nI mean, was Philip just such a shifty character and was more concerned with shooting Vera, that he didn't care to clarify his confusion in how Armstrong or Bear were murdered??? And we're just supposed to not wonder about this character at all just because he was shot so quickly in the end, without having any conversation about the murders or the job he was on at all between he and Vera?\n\nDid anyone else wonder about this??\n\nAt the very least, I would've thought that Philip would've also known about Wargrove being alive, aside from Dr. Armstrong, for him to not care about how Blore died while he and Vera were out on on the cliffs.\n\nDid I miss something?\n\nWhat do yall think?", "date_utc": 1759336407.0, "title": "Possible Plot Hole?/Thoughts about Philip Lombard in Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None book", "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "score": 9, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1nvd35b/possible_plot_holethoughts_about_philip_lombard/"}, {"id": "1numspb", "name": "t3_1numspb", "content": "I added the Spoiler tag but really, this is all going to be spoilers for this book and the preceding book Bunny. \n\nThere\u2019s a TL:DR\n\nI know Mona Awad is a feminist satirist. I know she\u2019s \u201cthe heir apparent\u201d of Margaret Atwood, according to Atwood. I loved *All\u2019s Well* and *Rouge.* That\u2019s why I\u2019m so confused by this book. Am I missing something? I must be, right? Because this was one of the most appallingly misogynist books I\u2019ve read in a long time.\n\nIf anyone can help me see what I missing, I would be so grateful. (Or if you think I\u2019m right and if this was by a guy it would be absolutely pilloried, I\u2019d be interested to hear that too!) \n\nSo\u2026\n\nTo prepare for reading it I reread **Bunny.** It\u2019s a biting satire of MFA programs, and as someone who worked at a college with a prominent one I really enjoyed that part \u2013 but I was uncomfortable with the bunnies. Partly with having that kind of performative femininity with the braids and the dresses and the upspeak be an endless comedy target in itself, but also\u2014 especially\u2014 the ending where they are all turned against each other by being fucked by the same man, whom they all lose their minds over, who exposes them as frenemies\u2026 That part wasn\u2019t great.\n\nMore \u201cMean Girls\u201d than not.\n\nBut there are so many other things I love about the book. She writes so beautifully. You are on Samantha\u2019s side throughout. So\u2026\n\nOn to **We Love You, Bunny**\n\nSo this is a prequel, set the year before. Here we learn more about the bunnies and they are constantly presented as pathetic and evil objects of scorn \u2013 we are invited to mock their bulimia, horrific self-harming, their horrible treatment by their parents \u2013 but some of that isn\u2019t funny? \n\nTheir friendship is also fake from the beginning, they all secretly hate each other, we all know these kinds of girly girls can\u2019t be *real* friends. \n\n**Silly Girls Being Triggered**\nI was unpleasantly surprised when Awad went fullbore mocking students being \u201ctriggered\u201d \u2013 honestly, it read like she was channeling Charlie Kirk. The scene where Coraline\u2019s work is destroyed in the writing workshop and she cries in the garden and yes, hyperbolically says that she feels violated, and the other bunnies comfort her, is presented as something over the top and ridiculous\u2014 so stupid that almost all the men in the book make fun of it at one point or another. \n\nAs a reader, though, I didn\u2019t have any trouble empathizing with Coraline in that moment. It\u2019s would be awful to have that happened to you, people critiquing you whose names you hadn\u2019t even learned yet, and I\u2019m not sure about shaming her for holding it together in the workshop but crying afterward, and her friends hugging her? Why is that so stupid? Why are we supposed to agree with the men shaming her for that?\n\n**Women Just Need to Get Laid\u2014 And Older Women Are a Bit Gross**\n\nSo they create a boy, Aereus, and then they have to hold onto him because *of course* they have no talent of their own. Despite the fact that I thought in both books their writing sounded kind of interesting, obviously you\u2019re not supposed to think that. And these women are nothing without a man.\n\nThey\u2019re not the only ones of course. Their teacher, Ursula, who is older, also has no talent without a male muse.\n\nDid we need to describe the older woman as both \u201cbarren\u201d and \u201cwithered\u201d? Apparently.\n\nSo you have these women chasing this male muse all over the city. (The bunnies are actually also trying to keep him from committing murder, which seems like a good thing\u2026? I mean, shouldn\u2019t he be locked up?)\n\n**Men Are Wise and Creative**\n\nLet\u2019s talk male characters.\n\nWe have Jonah, who is perfect, as in the first book.\n\nWe have Aereus, who is the male muse whom every woman in the book needs to take inspiration from and also wants to fuck desperately. \n\nWe have Allan, who was a predator in the first book, and a real asshole to his students in this one, but has **deep and profound wisdom** to impart because he doesn\u2019t need a muse. \n\nHe\u2019s a man. He\u2019s creative all on his own. \n\nAnd then we have the male poets who also keep Aereus as a muse, and here you might think they would be equivalent to the bunnies. But they are not. Masculinity is not in any way satirized. The poets are not shown to be fake friends. Their decor, food choices, histories, are never mentioned. They barely exist as characters, to be fair.\n\n**TL:DR  What am I missing?**\n\nHow is any of this, any of it at all, feminist? Am I supposed to be laughing at Coraline\u2018s self-harm or agree with the men shaming a girl for daring to cry after a brutal critique of her prose? How do I understand all the older men being brilliant  artists but the older woman being \u201cbarren\u201d and \u201cwithered\u201d as a feminist statement?\n\nIf you know, let me know. \n\n", "date_utc": 1759260783.0, "title": "Just finished We Love You, Bunny and it was really\u2026 misogynist\u2026 am I wrong?", "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "score": 324, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1numspb/just_finished_we_love_you_bunny_and_it_was_really/"}, {"id": "1nva0bd", "name": "t3_1nva0bd", "content": "After it's placement on the Booker Prize longlist this year, Universality has been getting a fair amount of attention, which is frankly impressive for a satire that manages to say almost nothing.\n\nThere's certainly satire, the book clearly dislikes the current right-wing obsession with anti-wokeness and anti-DEI; it rips apart the \"intellectual dark web\" types, race \"realists\", IQ believers, and the rest of the current alt-right. At the same time, however, it paints left-leaning activists in as much a negative light. Too obsessed with identity and largely just lazy bums who abandon their leftist \"principles\" as soon as it becomes convenient for them. The book seems to say \"Isn't the anti-woke crowd a bunch of grifting racists,\" while at the same time adding, \"But maybe the left is too woke. Maybe DEI is bad after all.\"\n\nNone of the characters are truly sympathetic, but it's telling, perhaps, that the only character portrayed in first-person during the novel is the politically scattered Lenny. She's ostensibly feminist, but not really, believes that racism and sexism aren't real problems, only classism, and scorns the left as being too woke. In other words, she's functionally JK Rowling. While the book goes to great pains to tell you she has no coherent ideology, her ideology is center-right, and while she is critiqued, the book seems to suggest, \"She might lie to others, but at least she's honest with herself.\"\n\nNow, I will say, as a socialist myself, that a class-focused lens is the one I use in politics, but not to the point that I deny the existence of racism, sexism, or other prejudices. Certainly, leftists believe class to be the largest driving force in politics, but the whole point of intersectionality, which in many ways has dominated the 2010s and 2020s, was to show that the combination of identities leads to unique experiences within the social structure.\n\nBrown herself muddies the waters further. I confess, I haven't read her other book, and I've only read a few interviews, but she seems as politically scattered as Lenny, though perhaps not holding all the same beliefs. She, too, seems to find DEI useless, at least from the interviews I've seen. She also finds STEM to be more fruitful than the arts, a common opinion among right and center-right thinkers. She's black, but also spent years in finance, so certainly Lenny's \"class first\" approach to right-populism fits a certain worldview among people who are marginalized by race, but not class. Do I think she's right-wing? Probably not, although it's hard to say. Certainly, she holds some right-wing views it feels.\n\nAll of this would be fine, frankly. A book which disagrees with me politically isn't exactly a scandal, nor does it make the book bad. But I wonder what the point of satire is. In my mind, satire exists to critique, yes, but with purpose. It doesn't just point and say \"isn't this dumb,\" it has an argument about the way the world should be. Universality seems to say that the world should be, more or less, exactly how it is now. That yes there are problems, but the people who claim to want to solve them are just as bad. Yes there are racists and bigots, but they're largely fringe. The end message is one of milquetoast centrism, that things should be as they are and that the biggest divide is one on class, but that those who support a change to the class structure are wrong. In other words, it's exactly the kind of do-nothing political messaging that made it sure to create buzz among the liberal intelligentsia, and thus secure it's Booker longlist.\n\nWhat do others think?

It\u2019s brutal, raw, and Scarlett O'Hara is emotionally incapable of experiencing love. It\u2019s bold of Mitchell to make her main character so unlikable. The ending with the famous line \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn\u201d was perfect. I honestly might reread the last chapter again. I think my favorite part of the novel is the timeline of life before, during, and after the civil war. It really could be considered a Great War novel as well. Though, I recognize it\u2019s not at all accurate and romanticizes slavery and the south. It was hard to get through some of this, especially how she wrote the black characters\u2019 dialogues and the reoccurring racial slurs. That being said, it was interesting to read someone\u2019s perspective who thought this way. It made me think about how when we are in school we are mostly taught the civil war from the north perspective.

Participants were asked to assign adjectives from a list to these sound samples, as well as decide which roles in fantasy or science fiction would fit the languages best. They were asked if they recognised the language and to speculate where in our world this language might be spoken if it was a natural (that is, not an invented) language.\n\nIn total, 90 people were kind enough to take the survey. Since I have finished evaluating the responses I received, I wanted to give everyone an overview of the results.\n\n\\---------------------------\n\nMy survey was split into **two parts**\u2014a listening section, followed by more general questions about participant demographics, prior knowledge of invented languages, and opinions about their usage in fiction. In this post, I will only show you the results of the listening section, since that was the biggest and most important part.\n\nThe **questions** participants answered were:\n\n1. What adjectives would you use to describe the sound of this invented language?\n   1. good\n   2. evil\n   3. peaceful\n   4. aggressive\n   5. pleasant\n   6. unpleasant\n   7. beautiful\n   8. ugly\n   9. soft\n   10. harsh\n   11. melodic\n   12. discordant\n   13. civilised\n   14. barbarous\n   15. familiar\n   16. unfamiliar\n   17.

They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.\n   2. a people who place much importance on honour, combat prowess, and strength in all matters of life. They often stand in conflict with other people but aren\u2019t necessarily evil.\n   3. an ancient, noble, and mystical people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.\n   4. a people whose history is much younger compared to that of other species in the world. They are often a jack of all trades when it comes to magic or mystical abilities, though rarely true masters, and highly adaptable.\n   5. a small, jovial people who value comforts such as food, drink, leisure, and peace more than personal glory or wealth. They are often overlooked by members of other species but are just as capable of great deeds.\n   6. a violent people known to raid and pillage other settlements. Either they are the main antagonists of their setting, serve a greater power of evil, or work with it for their own gain.\n   7. an industrious people who are renowned for their craftsmanship and skills as smiths and creators of functional yet beautiful works of art. To outsiders they seem gruff and short-tempered, but they are also noble and value honesty and honour.\n   8. a massive empire that controls a vast territory with many citizens. They are highly advanced in many aspects such as industry, technology, military, and artistry. They either violently subjugated surrounding peoples or reign over them peacefully.\n4.

Unsure / Don\u2019t want to say\n\n**Without further ado, let\u2019s see how participants rated the invented languages.**\n\n# 1) Ad\u00fbnaic (JRR Tolkien)\n\nAd\u00fbnaic is one of the languages JRR. Tolkien invented for his world, Arda. It was the native tongue of the N\u00famen\u00f3reans and was spread by them throughout Middle-earth. Westron, the common speech or lingua franca among the Free Peoples of the West (which Tolkien \u2018translated\u2019 into English in his novels), descends from Ad\u00fbnaic. It seems to be heavily inspired by Semitic languages such as Hebrew.^(1)\n\nThe passage I used has been named the \u201cLament of Akallab\u00eath\u201d and can be found in the journal *Vinyar Tengwar*, number 24.\n\n^(1) See for example Zak Cramer, \u201cJewish influences in Middle-earth\u201d, jstor.org/stable/45320162.\n\nThe 3 **adjectives** chosen the most for Ad\u00fbnaic are **harsh (14%)**, **pleasant (11%)**, and **unfamiliar (10%)**. **2** people further thought that it sounded **serious**.\n\nThe two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Ad\u00fbnaic are\n\n* \u201ca massive **empire** that controls a vast territory with many citizens. They are **highly advanced** in many aspects such as industry, technology, military, and artistry. They either violently subjugated surrounding peoples or reign over them peacefully.\u201d **(21%)**\n* \u201can **industrious people** who are renowned for their **craftsmanship** and skills as smiths and creators of functional yet beautiful works of art. To outsiders they seem gruff and short-tempered, but they are also **noble and value honesty and honour**.\u201d **(16%)**\n\n2 people **recognised** Ad\u00fbnaic; 2 rightly attributed it to Tolkien, though one of those responses misidentified it as Khuzdul/Dwarvish; 1 person said it reminded them of Dovahzul (from Bethesda\u2019s *Skyrim*); and 5 people either thought it comes from *Game of Thrones* or misidentified it as Dothraki.\n\nRegarding **location** in the real world, **33%** located it in **North Africa and the Middle East**. 4 people thought it could belong to the Semitic language family and 1 specifically compared it to Hebrew.\n\n# 2) Black Speech (JRR Tolkien)\n\nThe Black Speech of Mordor is one of the languages JRR Tolkien invented for his world, Arda. It was created by the Dark Lord Sauron and was meant to be the language spoken by all his servants and subjects, though these efforts ultimately failed.^(1) The Ring Verse (\u201cash nazg\u2026\u201d) is written in this language.\n\nThe passage participants heard is a combination of words Tolkien coined but wouldn\u2019t immediately be recognised and words I created following the rules and ratios Tolkien used.\n\n^(1) *The Lord of the Rings*, Appendix F:I.\n\nThe three **adjectives** chosen the most for the Black Speech are **harsh (23%)**, **discordant (13%)**, and **unfamiliar (11%)**. **2** people thought it sounded **powerful and strong**.\n\nThe two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of the Black Speech are\n\n* \u201ca massive **empire** that controls a vast territory with many citizens. They are **highly advanced** in many aspects such as industry, technology, military, and artistry. They either violently subjugated surrounding peoples or reign over them peacefully.\u201d **(21%)**\n* \u201can industrious people who are renowned for their **craftsmanship** and skills as smiths and creators of functional yet beautiful works of art. To outsiders they seem gruff and short-tempered, but they are also **noble and value honesty and honour**.\u201d **(16%)**\n\n2 people **recognised** the Black Speech; 2 rightly attributed it to Tolkien, though one of those responses misidentified it as Khuzdul/Dwarvish; 1 person said it reminded them of Dovahzul (from Bethesda\u2019s *Skyrim*); and 5 people either thought it comes from *Game of Thrones* or misidentified it as Dothraki.\n\nRegarding **location** in the real world, **33%** located it in **North Africa and the Middle East**. 1 person was reminded of Russian, 2 of German, and 1 person said it either sounds like a Middle Eastern or a Central Asian language.\n\n# 3) Dothraki (here specifically from Game of Thrones)\n\nDothraki is the language spoken by the horse riders of the same name that George R.R. Martin invented for his *A Song of Ice and Fire* universe. When HBO adapted the novels for their TV show Game of Thrones, they hired the language creator David J. Peterson to expand upon the languages Martin invented. The lines participants heard were from the TV show.\n\nThe three **adjectives** chosen the most for Dothraki are **soft (13%)**, **pleasant (13%)**, **familiar (9%)**, **melodic (9%)**, **peaceful (9%)**, and **unfamiliar (9%)**.\n\nThe two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Dothraki are\n\n* \u201can **industrious people** who are renowned for their **craftsmanship** and skills as smiths and creators of functional yet beautiful works of art. To outsiders they seem gruff and short-tempered, but they are also **noble and value honesty and honour**.\u201d **(16%)**\n* \u201ca massive **empire** that controls a vast territory with many citizens. They are **highly advanced** in many aspects such as industry, technology, military, and artistry. They either violently subjugated surrounding peoples or reign over them peacefully.\u201d **(15%)**\n* \u201ca people who place much importance on **honour, combat prowess, and strength** in all matters of life. They often stand in conflict with other people but aren\u2019t necessarily evil.\u201d **(15%)**\n\n4 people **recognised** Dothraki and 2 rightly attributed it to *Game of Thrones*. 1 person was reminded of the constructed language Keva, 1 of *Avatar*, and 1 person said that \u201c\\[i\\]t doesn't sound like a Conlang. Kind of feels like Celtic/Gaelic/something Scandinavian\u201d.\n\nRegarding **location** in the real world, **28%** located it in **North Africa and the Middle East**. Other associations are with Semitic languages (4), Scandinavian (2), German (1), \u201cAfrican\u201d (1), and Persian/Farsi (1).\n\n# 4) High Valyrian (here specifically from Game of Thrones)\n\nHigh Valyrian was the language of the Valyrian Freehold and the native tongue of the Targaryens from George R.R. Martin\u2019s *A Song of Ice and Fire universe*. The lines participants heard were from the TV show.\n\nThe three **adjectives** chosen the most for High Valyrian are **melodic (16%)**, **soft (16%)**, **pleasant (13%)**, and **peaceful (12%)**.\n\nThe two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of High Valyrian are\n\n* \u201can **ancient, noble, and mystical** people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.\u201d **(27%)**\n* \u201ca massive **empire** that controls a vast territory with many citizens. They are **highly advanced** in many aspects such as industry, technology, military, and artistry. They either violently subjugated surrounding peoples or reign over them peacefully.\u201d **(19%)**\n\n13 people **recognised** High Valyrian; 1 rightly attributed it to the language inventor for *Game of Thrones*, David J. Peterson, though misidentified it as Shiv\u00e4isith (*Thor: The Dark World*), just as another was reminded of the *Dune* movies which Peterson also worked on (*Dune Part 1* and *Dune Part 2*). 1 person said it reminded them of Na\u2019vi; and 1 of *The Lord of the Rings*.\n\nRegarding **location** in the real world, **30%** located it in **Western Europe**. 2 thought it could be a Romance language, 1 that it could be Latin, another located it in Scandinavia, 5 in Finland, and 2 in Greece.\n\n# 5) Khuzdul (JRR Tolkien)\n\nKhuzdul is the tongue of the Dwarves which J.R.R. Tolkien invented for his world, Arda. It was given to them by their Maker Mahal, whom the Elves call Aul\u00eb, and they guard it as a secret few outsiders ever learned.^(1) It is very deliberately based on Semitic languages such as Hebrew, which highlights the comparison Tolkien himself made between his Dwarves and Jewish people.^(2)\n\n^(1) The Lord of the Rings, Appendix F:I\n\n^(2) See for example Zak Cramer, \u201cJewish influences in Middle-earth\u201d, jstor.org/stable/45320162.\n\nThe three **adjectives** chosen the most for Khuzdul are **harsh (15%)**, **unfamiliar (10%)**, and **melodic (10%)**.\n\nThe two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Khuzdul are\n\n* \u201ca people who place much importance on **honour, combat prowess, and strength** in all matters of life. They often stand in conflict with other people but aren\u2019t necessarily evil.\u201d **(25%)**\n* \u201can industrious people who are renowned for their **craftsmanship** and skills as smiths and creators of functional yet beautiful works of art. To outsiders they seem gruff and short-tempered, but they are also **noble and value honesty and honour**.\u201d **(20%)**\n\n7 people **recognised** Khuzdul and 2 rightly attributed it to Tolkien, though 1 misattributed it to Mordor. 2 people guessed it was Klingon and 2 that it was Dothraki. 1 person guessed that it comes from *Game of Thrones* and 1 that it is Na\u2019vi.\n\nRegarding **location** in the real world, **28%** located it in **North Africa and the Middle East**. 3 people specifically mentioned Semitic languages and 2 German.\n\n# 6) Klingon (Star Trek)\n\nKlingon is the language spoken by the aliens of the same name from the *Star Trek* franchise. It was principally developed by Mark Okrand and was meant to sound \u2018alien\u2019, so Okrand included sounds and sound combinations that speakers of English generally wouldn\u2019t be familiar with.^(1) It is one of the most widely known invented languages and has a large fan base of speakers across the globe, such as the Klingon Language Institute.\n\nThe passage participants heard was a combination of several sentences [taken from the Klingon Wiki](https://www.klingonwiki.net/En). The last line, for example, was the beginning of the famous soliloquy from the Klingon version of Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet.\n\n^(1) See for example Okrand et al. \u201c\u2018Wild and Whirling Words\u2019: The Invention and Use of Klingon\u201d, in *From Elvish to Klingon: Exploring Invented Languages*\n\nThe three **adjectives** chosen the most for the Black Speech are **harsh (26%)**, **discordant (15%)**, and **unpleasant (14%)**. **2** participants also called it **strong and powerful**.\n\nThe two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of the Black Speech are\n\n* \u201ca people who place much importance on **honour, combat prowess, and strength** in all matters of life. They often stand in conflict with other people but aren\u2019t necessarily evil.\u201d **(30%)**\n* \u201ca **violent** people known to **raid and pillage** other settlements. Either they are the main antagonists of their setting, serve a greater power of evil, or work with it for their own gain.\u201d **(28%)**\n\n38 people **recognised** Klingon outright, with 1 additional person correctly attributing it to *Star Trek*. 2 people even wrote short comments in Klingon. Another person said it could be from *The Witcher*.\n\nRegarding **location** in the real world, **25%** were unsure or did not want to guess. 18% located it in North Africa and the Middle-east and 16% in Eastern Europe or Central Asia. 2 people said it did not sound like a human language; 1 person was reminded of Semitic languages and 1 person compared it to French.\n\n# 7) Na\u2019vi (James Cameron\u2019s Avatar)\n\nNa\u2019vi is spoken by the aliens of the same name from James Cameron\u2019s *Avatar* movie franchise. It was developed by Dr. Paul Frommer and has, as of now, two variants spoken by the forest and reef Na\u2019vi featured in the movies. It has a large community of learners across the globe who have even contributed to the development of the language itself.\n\nThe passage participants heard consists of several sentences taken from [Dr. Paul Frommer\u2019s blog about the Na\u2019vi language](https://naviteri.org/).\n\nThe three **adjectives** chosen the most for Na\u2019vi are **unfamiliar (13%)**, **discordant (11%)**, and **harsh (11%)**.\n\nThe two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Na\u2019vi are\n\n* \u201ca people who live in **harmony with the natural world around them**. They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.\u201d **(32%)**\n* \u201ca people who place much importance on **honour, combat prowess, and strength** in all matters of life. They often stand in conflict with other people but aren\u2019t necessarily evil.\u201d **(15%)**\n\n18 people **recognised** Na\u2019vi (since I also posted the survey to Na\u2019vi language servers, this high recognition rate is unsurprising).\n\nRegarding **location** in the real world, **37%** located it in **Sub-Saharan Africa**. 2 people specifically mentioned South Africa, where most click languages are found. It seems likely that participants equated ejectives (as in *Kal****tx****\u00ec*) with click consonants.\n\n# 8) Quenya (JRR Tolkien)\n\nQuenya is the language spoken by the Noldor Elves of J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s invented world, Arda. By the time of the Third Age, in which Tolkien\u2019s novels take place, it has primarily become the language of \u201cceremony, and for high matters of lore and song\u201d.^(1) It is heavily based on Finnish but also includes elements from Latin and Greek.\n\nThe passage participants heard was from the poem \u201cMarkirya\u201d, of which several versions can be found in *The Monsters, and the Critics, and other Essays*, as well as in *A Secret Vice: Tolkien on Invented Languages* (2020).\n\n^(1) *The Lord of the Rings*, Appendix F:I.\n\nThe three **adjectives** chosen the most for Quenya are **melodic (20%)**, **soft (15%)**, and **pleasant (14%)**. **2** people further thought it sounded **ancient**.\n\nThe two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Quenya are\n\n* \u201can **ancient, noble, and mystical** people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.\u201d **(37%)**\n* \u201ca people who live in **harmony with the natural world around them**. They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.\u201d **(24%)**\n\n3 people **recognised** Quenya; 4 identified it as \u201cElvish\u201d, and 4 rightly attributed it to Tolkien. 1 person said it reminded them of High Valyrian.\n\nRegarding **location** in the real world, **25%** located it in **Western Europe**. 1 person was reminded of Latin and another person of Finnish. 2 located it somewhere in Poly-, Austro-, or Melanesia, and 3 somewhere in Scandinavia.\n\n# 9) Simlish (Electronic Arts\u2019 The Sims)\n\nSimlish is the language spoken by the eponymous characters controlled by the player in *The Sims* video game franchise by Electronic Arts. It was first used in 1996 in *Sim Copter* and was created as an emotive language with which the players could tell their own stories^(1). Many singers such as Katy Perry or the Black-Eyed Peas have re-recorded songs in this language.\n\nThe passage participants heard comes from the Simlish version of Bebe Rexha\u2019s song *Sabotage*, which I transcribed.\n\n^(1) See for example James Portnow, \u201cGaming Languages and Language Games\u201d, in *From Elvish to Klingon: Exploring Invented Languages*.\n\nThe three **adjectives** chosen the most for Simlish are **soft (18%)**, **pleasant (13%)**, and **peaceful (11%)**. **3** people further thought that it sounded **playful**, **funny**, or **goofy**.\n\nThe two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Simlish are\n\n* \u201ca people who live in **harmony with the natural world around them**. They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.\u201d **(28%)**\n* \u201ca people whose **history is much younger** compared to that of other species in the world. They are often a **jack of all trades** when it comes to magic or mystical abilities, though rarely true masters, and are **highly adaptable**.\u201d **(18%)**\n\n1 person **recognised** Simlish. Someone said it reminded them of Trigadeslang (*The 100*), another that it sounds like something from *Star Wars*, and 1 person compared it to English.\n\nRegarding **location** in the real world, **23%** located it in **Western Europe**. 3 people specifically said that it reminded them of English.\n\n# 10) Sindarin (JRR Tolkien)\n\nSindarin is one of the languages J.R.R. Tolkien invented for his world, Arda. It is the native tongue of the Sindar, the Grey Elves, and many of the place and character names in Middle-earth are taken from it. Sindarin was deliberately designed by Tolkien to be similar to Welsh,^(1) which can be seen in its sound, grammar, and other linguistic aspects.\n\nThe passage participants heard is from the King\u2019s Letter, which Tolkien wrote for an abandoned epilogue to *The Lord of the Rings*, as well as a sentence from *The Unfinished Tales* into which I added a word to include the *lh* /\u026c/ sound.\n\n^(1) See for example Tolkien, \u201cEnglish and Welsh\u201d, in *The Monsters and the Critics, and Other Essays*.\n\nThe three **adjectives** chosen the most for Sindarin are **melodic (17%)**, **soft (14%)**, and **pleasant (12%)**.\n\nThe two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Sindarin are\n\n* \u201can **ancient, noble, and mystical** people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.\u201d **(42%)**\n* \u201ca people who live in **harmony with the natural world around them**. They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.\u201d **(22%)**\n\n6 people **recognised** Sindarin; 9 identified it as \u201cElvish\u201d, and 7 rightly attributed it to Tolkien. 1 person was reminded of Astaporian Valyrian from *Game of Thrones*.\n\nRegarding **location** in the real world, **36%** located it in **Western Europe**. 6 people located it in Scandinavia, 4 people said it sounded Celtic or Gaelic, and 1 person was reminded of Latin.\n\n\\---------------------------\n\n**For the following samples, you need** [a little knowledge about the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)](https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/content/full-ipa-chart) (link leads to the full chart). The IPA categorises speech sounds according to their manner and location of articulation. Sounds made, for example, with both lips, such as /m p b/, are called *bilabial* consonants. /p b/ are *stops*, which are articulated by stopping and then releasing the flow of air, while /m/ is a *nasal* consonant, as air flows through the nose.\n\n# 11) Sketch 1\n\nOne of the sketches I made specifically for this survey. This sketch only features labial (made with the lips), coronal (with the tongue), and palatal (at the hard palate in the middle of the mouth) sounds, the one exception being /h/. It is heavily skewered towards sonorants such as nasals and liquids, only has two voiced stops /b d/, uses far more front vowels /a e i/ than back vowels /u o/, and has a lot of long vowels.\n\nThe three **adjectives** chosen the most for Sketch 1 are **soft (20%)**, **melodic (18%)**, and **peaceful (14%)**.\n\nThe two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Sketch 1 are\n\n* \u201can **ancient, noble, and mystical** people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.\u201d **(32%)**\n* \u201ca people who live in **harmony with the natural world around them**. They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.\u201d **(31%)**\n\n1 person thought Sketch 1 was Sindarin and 9 that it was one of Tolkien\u2019s (Elvish) languages. 2 people thought it comes from *Game of Thrones*.\n\nRegarding **location** in the real world, **33%** located it in **Western Europe**. Other associations are Celtic/Gaelic (1) and Scandinavian (2).\n\n# 12) Sketch 2\n\nOne of the sketches I made specifically for this survey. This sketch uses many stops and fricatives and combines them in clusters of up to four consonants. It only has the velar nasal /\u014b/, so no /n/ and /m/, and features a lot of other velars /k g x \u0263/, as well as the uvulars /q/ and /\u0280/, and the glottal stop /\u0294/. It uses far more back vowels /u o \u0251/ than front vowels /i e a/ and more short vowels than long ones.\n\nThe three **adjectives** chosen the most for Sketch 2 are **harsh (20%)**, **discordant (19%)**, and **unpleasant (16%)**.\n\nThe two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Sketch 2 are\n\n* \u201ca **violent** people known to **raid and pillage** other settlements. Either they are the main antagonists of their setting, serve a greater power of evil, or work with it for their own gain.\u201d **(27%)**\n* \u201ca people who place much importance on **honour, combat prowess, and strength** in all matters of life. They often stand in conflict with other people but aren\u2019t necessarily evil.\u201d **(26%)**\n\n5 people thought that this was Klingon. 1 person guessed that it came from *Star Trek*, 1 from *Avatar* and 1 from *Star Wars*.\n\nRegarding **location** in the real world, **28%** located it in **Eastern Europe and Central Asia**. 2 people were reminded of Russian and 2 of German(ic) languages.\n\n# 13) Sketch 3\n\nOne of the sketches I made specifically for this survey. This sketch uses a combination of sounds made at the front of the mouth and sounds made at the back of it. It thus stands directly in the middle of two other sketches (Sketch 1 and Sketch 2) in which I use predominantly (or exclusively) front or back sounds respectively. In this sketch I used exactly the same amount of front and back sounds and included consonant clusters of no more than two consonants.\n\nThe three **adjectives** chosen the most for Sketch 3 are **harsh (13%)**, **melodic (10%)**, **pleasant (10%)**, and **unfamiliar (10%)**.\n\nThe two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Sketch 3 are\n\n* \u201can **ancient, noble, and mystical** people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.\u201d **(18%)**\n* \u201can **industrious people** who are renowned for their **craftsmanship** and skills as smiths and creators of functional yet beautiful works of art. To outsiders they seem gruff and short-tempered, but they are also **noble and value honesty and honour**.\u201d **(18%)**\n* \u201ca massive **empire** that controls a vast territory with many citizens. They are **highly advanced** in many aspects such as industry, technology, military, and artistry. They either violently subjugated surrounding peoples or reign over them peacefully.\u201d **(14%)**\n\n2 people thought it could be from *Game of Thrones*, with one specifically mentioning Dothraki.\n\nRegarding **location** in the real world, **22%** were unsure or declined to assign one. **20%** thought it could be from **Western Europe** and another **20%** that it could be from **Central and South-Eastern Europe**.\n\n# 14) Sketch 4\n\nOne of the sketches I made specifically for this survey. This sketch is very similar to another one, in which I exclusively use consonants made at the front of the mouth (so labial, coronal, and palatal) with the exception of /h/, and predominantly the front vowels /a e i/. The difference between that sketch and this one is that I have included the two velar sounds /x \u0263/ and the glottal stop /\u0294/ to test whether this small addition is enough to affect the way participants evaluate this sketch compared to the other one.\n\nThe three **adjectives** chosen the most for Sketch 4 are **harsh (13%)**, **melodic (13%)**, **pleasant (13%)**, and **unfamiliar (11%)**.\n\nThe two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Sketch 4 are\n\n* \u201can **ancient, noble, and mystical** people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.\u201d **(25%)**\n* \u201ca people who live in **harmony with the natural world around them**. They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.\u201d **(16%)**\n\n2 people thought that Sketch 4 could be Sindarin, while 3 thought it was some form of \u201cElvish\u201d. Other guesses include Na\u2019vi (1) and Hildegard von Bingen\u2019s \u201cunknown language\u201d (1), likely meaning Lingua Ignota.\n\nRegarding **location** in the real world, **32%** located it in **Western Europe** and **28%** in **North Africa and the Middle-east**.\n\n# 15) Sketch 5\n\nOne of the sketches I made specifically for this survey. This sketch is very similar to another one in its predominant use of sounds made at the front of the mouth (so labial, coronal, and palatal) with the exception of /h/, and the preference for front vowels /a e i/. What differentiates this sketch from that one is the inclusion of something akin to lexical tone, though very exaggerated. In tonal languages, the meaning of a word or word segment can differ depending on the pitch with which it is said. This sketch is meant to test whether tones affect the way participants evaluate this sketch compared to the other one.\n\nThe three **adjectives** chosen the most for Sketch 5 are **melodic (21%)**, **unfamiliar (19%)**, and **unpleasant (11%)**. 6 people called it **robotic**, 6 other people **alien**, and 2 **fun** or **jolly**.\n\nThe two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Sketch 5 are\n\n* \u201ca people who live in **harmony with the natural world around them**. They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.\u201d **(30%)**\n* \u201can **ancient, noble, and mystical** people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.\u201d **(20%)**\n* \u201ca **small, jovial** people who **value comforts** such as food, drink, leisure, and peace more than personal glory or wealth. They are often overlooked by members of other species but are just as capable of great deeds.\u201d **(20%)**\n\n3 people thought Sketch 5 could be Solresol, an invented language that is sung or played on musical instruments.\n\nRegarding **location** in the real world, **34%** located it in **Asia and the Pacific**; **3%** narrowed this down further to **(South)East Asia**. **31%** were Unsure and **12%** said that it was like **no natural** language, **alien**, or **robotic**.\n\n# 16) Sketch 6\n\nOne of the sketches I made specifically for this survey. This sketch uses so-called click consonants, which are only found in [1.8% of the 449 languages analysed by Ian Maddieson on WALS Online](https://wals.info/chapter/19), all of them coming from southern and eastern Africa. It also has an unusually low vowel inventory with only three sounds, /a i u/. Combining these incredibly rare sounds with the most common consonants found in languages worldwide,^(1) I am testing whether unfamiliar sounds affect the way participants evaluate this sketch compared to the other ones.\n\n^(1) See the [UCLA Phonetics Lab](https://phonetics.linguistics.ucla.edu/sales/software.htm#upsid).\n\nThe three **adjectives** chosen the most for Sketch 6 are **unfamiliar (16%)**, **discordant (11%)**, and **melodic (10%)**. **5** people called it **fun(ny) or jolly**, **2** **\u201cclick-y\u201d**, **2 \u201cprimitive\u201d** **or \u201ctribal\u201d**, and **2 interesting**.\n\nThe two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Sketch 6 are\n\n* \u00b7\u201ca people who live in **harmony with the natural world around them**. They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.\u201d **(33%)**\n* \u201ca **small, jovial** people who **value comforts** such as food, drink, leisure, and peace more than personal glory or wealth. They are often overlooked by members of other species but are just as capable of great deeds.\u201d **(18%)**\n\n1 person thought this was Na\u2019vi; 1 that it was Kelen or Itkul, two constructed languages; 2 that it comes from *Star Trek*, and 1 that it comes from *Star Wars*.\n\nRegarding **location** in the real world, **73%** located it in **Sub-Saharan Africa**, with **10%** being more specific with **South Africa**. Xhosa (3), Zulu (1), Khoisan languages (1), and Hausa (1) were mentioned, out of which all but Hausa are natural click languages.\n\n# 17) T\u00e0rhama\n\nT\u00e0rhama is one of my own invented languages which I have been working on for several years. Its speakers are a humanoid species of aliens with nine sub-species, each of which has its own language that descends from T\u00e0rhama. In creating the phonology of T\u00e0rhama, I only used sounds and sound combinations that I enjoy or find interesting.\n\nThe three **adjectives** chosen the most for T\u00e0rhama are **unfamiliar (14%)**, **harsh (13%)**, and **pleasant (11%)**.\n\nThe two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of T\u00e0rhama are\n\n* \u201can **ancient, noble, and mystical** people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.\u201d **(19%)**\n* \u201can **industrious people** who are renowned for their **craftsmanship** and skills as smiths and creators of functional yet beautiful works of art. To outsiders they seem gruff and short-tempered, but they are also **noble and value honesty and honour**.\u201d **(17%)**\n* \u201ca people who place much importance on **honour, combat prowess, and strength** in all matters of life. They often stand in conflict with other people but aren\u2019t necessarily evil.\u201d **(17%)**\n\n1 person thought T\u00e0rhama could be from *The Lord of the Rings*; 1 from *Star Trek*; and 1 that it could be High Valyrian.\n\nRegarding **location** in the real world, **25%** located it in **North Africa and the Middle East**. 2 were reminded of German and 2 of Semitic languages.\n\n# 18) Wi:\u00e7\u01ebthash\u00ecg\u00e4\n\nWi:\u00e7\u01ebthash\u00ecg\u00e4 is one of my own invented languages and is part of a language family which I have been working on since June 2024. The language family, and its alien speakers, are very deliberately based on the Haudenosaunee and their Iroquoian languages.\n\nThe three **adjectives** chosen the most for Wi:\u00e7\u01ebthash\u00ecg\u00e4 are **soft (14%)**, **melodic (13%)**, and **pleasant (11%)**. Unsurprisingly, given the inclusion of nasal vowels (as in French), **2** people called Wi:\u00e7\u01ebthash\u00ecg\u00e4 **nasal**.\n\nThe two **roles** that participants thought best fit speakers of Wi:\u00e7\u01ebthash\u00ecg\u00e4 are\n\n* \u201ca people who live in **harmony with the natural world around them**. They have a close connection to their environment and value all plants and animals that share their home.\u201d **(23%)**\n* \u201can **ancient, noble, and mystical** people with a long history. They are wise, graceful, skilled, and possess great powers. Their prime is long behind and few of them remain.\u201d **(17%)**\n\nGuesses about which invented language this is include \u201cTolkien\u2019s Elven languages\u201d (1), \u201cAvatar Na\u2019vi\u201d (1), and *Star Wars* (1).\n\nRegarding **location** in the real world, **24%** located it in **Eastern Europe and Central Asia** and **23%** in **North America**. 1 person specifically mentioned Native American languages and guessed \u201c\\[m\\]aybe Iroquoian, maybe Algonquian\u201d.\n\n\\---------------------------\n\nIf you have made it this far, thank you for your time. I\u2019d like to once again thank all participants. The survey will be immensely useful for my PhD dissertation and future research in this field. It is possible that my results will be published in an academic journal, so keep an eye out for that, if you are interested.\n\nAt any rate, ***qatlho\u2019*** (Klingon, thank you) and ***nam\u00e1ri\u00eb*** (Quenya, farewell).", "date_utc": 1759234675.0, "title": "Surveying Invented Languages and Their Speakers: Survey Results", "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "score": 28, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1nubluk/surveying_invented_languages_and_their_speakers/"}, {"id": "1ntvwng", "name": "t3_1ntvwng", "content": "Writing this puts me at the risk of exposing myself to some members in a book circle, but I must rant. \n\nCurrently I'm reading Maja Lunde's book \"Binas Historia\" (title translates to \"history of the bees\", I don't think the book is translated to English). The only reason I'm reading it is to participate in a book circle, and while it's overall quite good I would have stopped reading it before the first chapter was over if it wasn't for the book circle.\n\nApparently, together with bees, ladders have also gone extinct by the year 2098. One of the characters has to hand pollinate the flowers of fruit trees (many chapters later revealed to be pears), and the description goes to great lengths describing what a gruelling job it is for her, and how bad we should feel for the workers who have to... climb the fruit trees to manually pollinate them? Climbing up and standing on branches? To reach the *flowers*? All this while the fruit trees are so valuable that the character is terrified of breaking the branches?\n\nThe thing is, I've grown up with fruit trees. I've spent a lot of weekends helping my dad prune fruit trees and pick fruit. Standing on the branches is absolutely asinine because we have **ladders**. You don't even have to lean them against the tree, you can use the A-shaped ones that can stand on their own to reach far out branches! \n\nMeanwhile I'm not sure if this author has ever even seen a full-sized fruit tree. I want to know what kind of trees she's envisioning when she's writing the pollination scenes. Into what shapes have those trees been pruned?? Just to accommodate this lack of ladders???\n\nIt's such a small detail but I can't get over it. **Everything else** in the book so far has been quite fine, and very realistic, but just as I had almost gotten over the tree climbing in the first chapter, a later chapter casually reveals that they also climb the trees to pick the fruit.\n\nNow I really want to know what the author was thinking.\n\nEven if all ladders have gone extinct together with the bees, even if for whatever reason you can't surround the tree with fruit harvesting nets, you still don't need to climb trees to pick fruit! We've got fruit pickers for that! It's a long stick with a bag at the end. Raise the stick until the fruit is in the bag. Wiggle it just a little. Ripe fruit will fall of the branch and into the bag. You get a crick in the neck doing it too long but! You don't need to climb the tree! At all! It's a very simple tool, you can make it yourself with items foraged from your local junk yard!\n\nAlso, I know that the author knows that ladders exist, because other parts of the book take place in 2007 and during one of those chapters one the characters use a ladder to remove a lightbulb. \n\nSo, apparently, at some point between 2007 and 2098 ladders go extinct. Possibly more extinct than the bees - people still think about bees. Ladders have seemingly just vanished from their reality and the character at no point wistfully think \"people used to have ladders for this\".\n\n...\n\nAnyway, that was an awful lot of words to say that I'm going completely insane and tearing my hair over a detail that so far isn't even remotely plot relevant, it's an objectively insignificant line presumably only added to make a character more pitiful and yet I can't get past it.

The scene was still very interesting.\n\nI think some scenes were lost on me, especially with the locations. I kept reimagining some parts. Also at times I felt the writer was going somewhere but wasn't, such as when one of the biguns holds the kid to talk about the beast, and the kid sagged and yawned. It was preceded by the line \"something strange happened\", which gave it a certain otherworldly air, and I had assumed at first that the kid had entered an unusual stage.

It has pretentious, filthy rich literary characters being shitty and doing nothing, the bane of so many worse literary novels. Literally, she does almost nothing. She sleeps, she wakes up, she takes pills, she blacks out and does something crazy and we never learn exactly what, she takes more pills and sleeps again. And she suffers basically no consequences, physically or mentally from taking a dozen sleeping pills a day FOR A YEAR. Even though Reva, the unnamed MC's friend, is just as messed up as the MC in certain ways, she's the only thing tethering the MC to the real world, and she consistently pushes Reva away... until the end, which you can tell what's going to happen about three quarters of the way through.\n\nOn the other hand, I was in the mood for a book like this, where the MC is unlikeable, nearly unredeemable, not because they're inherently bad, but because they're so fucking vapid they can't see out of their own head. Depression is like that, though. The MC's wealth doesn't keep her from horrible depression that she disguises with her possibly fatal self help routine. The only good thing she has to say about herself is that she's still pretty, even after wasting away to nothing from sleeping pills. She hangs desperately, pathetically onto the memory of her awful ex boyfriend, because her parents showed her no empathy and she wants to be mistreated by someone. Attention = love. That's extremely relatable, even if she's too far gone in her own head to be totally sympathetic.\n\nMy favorite character, though, is Dr. Tuttle. She is an amazingly insane character, and a much-needed comic relief in the bleakness of the book, prescribing anything and everything she can get her hands on and rambling about stuff that isn't even pseudoscience, just health theories that make no sense. If there were any justice or sanity in that world, she'd lose her license, (or wouldn't be allowed to get one in the first place,) but that's besides the point.\n\nIt's the kind of book you have to be in a certain headspace to read, and that's OK.\n", "date_utc": 1759162127.0, "title": "Finished My Year of Rest and Relaxation, I loved it... but I understand why people hated it", "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "score": 284, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ntm5hu/finished_my_year_of_rest_and_relaxation_i_loved/"}, {"id": "1nu86nw", "name": "t3_1nu86nw", "content": "Welcome readers, \n        \nHave you ever wanted to ask something but you didn't feel like it deserved its own post but it isn't covered by one of our other scheduled posts?

It's intriguing to speculate what happened in between, because while *The Dead Secret* is a competent and entertaining bit of spooky storytelling, it shows little of the subsequent novel's much more complex, intriguing characterization and plotting.\n\nBut it's still a good little page-turner on the theme of how \u201cdead secrets\u201d are only playing dead. Collins displays his customary fascination with the law, money, sex, ambiguous identities, and physical disability. Sensation too is provided through hinky aristocratic doings on the Cornwall coast and a haunted North Wing. (In my head, the book is illustrated by Edward Gorey.)\u00a0\n\nThe mysteries\u2014of why prematurely gray-haired lady's maid Sarah Leeson departed Porthgenna Tower on the night of her mistress's death; the oaths she swore; her attachment to little Rosamond; the gravestone she visited; and the letter, the Dead Secret, she hid in the Myrtle Room\u2014these are all easily penetrated. But as Collins explained in a preface to the third edition: \"I thought it most desirable to let the effect of the story depend on expectation rather than surprise.\" And the interest of this novel lies not in detecting the mystery but in watching its unspooling.\n\nAfter the mysterious events of the opening chapter, the story begins again some 15 years later. Rosamond Treverton has married a Mr. Frankland, recently afflicted with blindness, and the two are travelling to Porthgenna, purchased from Rosamond's father before his death, where Rosamond plans to give birth. But the child is a month early, and the two must halt along the way and engage a nurse. The only one available, it turns out, is a Mrs. Jazeph, who is hiding her previous identity. She seriously freaks out Rosamond with her strange behavior\u2014especially the whispered injunction: \"*When you go to Porthgenna, keep out of the Myrtle Room!*\"\n\nOf course, nothing could make Rosamond more fiercely determined to discover the Myrtle Room and search it from top to bottom. As in Collins's *Poor Miss Finch*, blindness becomes a moral challenge for the seeing, who can easily be tempted to hide or alter what sight would reveal, whether for the blind person's own good or for other reasons. Money, too, is a Victorian test of character, and both the Franklands are put to the test. Whether they pass their tests; whether the whole truth becomes known; whether all is set right in the end\u2014that I leave you to guess.", "date_utc": 1759166160.0, "title": "The Dead Secret by Wilkie Collins (1857)", "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "score": 34, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ntnyfw/the_dead_secret_by_wilkie_collins_1857/"}, {"id": "1ntq4xl", "name": "t3_1ntq4xl", "content": "I\u2019m about a quarter of the way through listening to the audiobook on Spotify. This is the recently released published novel of what was originally a Harry Potter fan fiction. And apparently a movie is in the works too? Wild. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of a surreal reading experience because usually things go the other way \u2014- they start out as an original work then get riffed on in fan fiction. This one is a fan fiction that\u2019s taken on a life of its own. The only other one that I\u2019m aware of is the Twilight to 50 Shades of Grey progression, but I didn\u2019t follow any stage of that journey personally. \n\nI\u2019m enjoying Alchemised so far. The story beats are mostly the same as what was in the fan fiction. But I like that the world-building of the universe and the type of magic used feels extremely original, or at least extremely different from Harry Potter. That\u2019s enough to keep me on my toes and interested in what will be revealed next. \n\nI also like that some of the characters\u2019 relationships are more fleshed out. For example, Helena and Luke\u2019s friendship is much more dimensional than Hermione and Harry\u2019s was. You don\u2019t need as much backstory in fan fiction, and it\u2019s fun to find the parts of this new story that feel fresh. \n\nI also consider the original \u201cManacled\u201d to be just as much of a Handmaid\u2019s Tail riff as a Harry Potter one. (I don\u2019t know if my next comment is spoiler-y, but I\u2019m blotting it out just in case.)  >!At first, I thought that element had been removed from the story, but I\u2019m glad to see it make a reappearance. As brutal as it was in the original, I thought it raised the stakes of the plot so much and thought the rewrite was a little flat without it. Also, removing it completely would have required some major plot adjustments in the second half.!< \n\nSince the first quarter of the book has been similar but not identical to the fan fiction, I\u2019m curious if it will diverge more in later chapters. I feel like I know where the story is going, and I\u2019m okay with that, but I\u2019m looking forward to potential surprises. \n\nWondering what anyone else thinks. \n\nAlso, if anyone is curious but has not or does not want to read the fan fiction, you don\u2019t have to in order to enjoy \u201cAlchemised.\u201d I think it\u2019s a solid standalone story.

I recently read it again, and it seems more brilliant than the first time J.D.

Despite being criticized, for me it is one of the best... The plot is unique and fascinating, the book shows the ugly side of life, for many the only, Holden has a critical thinking that most people lack today, many people did not see the reasons behind Holden's thinking about hating all people (adults), and that everyone is hypocritical... His thoughts, his subliminal pain captivated me from beginning to end. I confess that i still feel uncomfortable in some parts of the book, but my empathy for the characters transcends that. Sallinger's way of showing how our negative experiences with adults during childhood mark us forever, and especially how we will see the world when we grow up, maybe teaches young readers to \"not want to become those adults,\" in a certain way... (at least that's how it was for me). In the end, you understand his fear of growing up, not because he doesn't want the responsibilities of adult life, but because he fears the loss of innocence and the ''falseness of the adult world'', and why he dreams about to live in the rye field and be the only \"adult\" taking care of the children...\u2013 \"Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all.

Any spooky or autumn themed books you're really excited to dive into this month?\n\nThe books I've planned for this Spooky Season:\n\n- **Harvest Home by Thomas Tryon (1973)** - I've already started this one. It's about a family moving from New York to a slower life in a rural New England community that seems frozen in the past. But the family doesn't mind the village's quaint veneration of tradition, at first. I'm just shy of 100 pages in so far, but enjoying it. I've previously read The Other and wasn't particularly taken by it, so far this one is more up my alley.\n\n- **Boys in the Valley by Philip Fraccasi (2023)** - Very excited for this one! I've heard so many great things about it since it's publication and have been waiting for it to get to paperback!\n\n- **The Haar by David Sodergren (2022)** - Another one I'm very excited for! I was hoping to read it last year, but as it's self-pub the only place I could find it was Amazon. This year I happily found it at my local independent horror bookshop.\n\n- **Mexican Gothic by Silvia Moreno-Garcia (2020)** - Another I've been curious to read for a while.\n\n- **The Empty House and Other Ghost Stories by Algernon Blackwood (1906)** - I always make sure to have at least 1 horror/gothic short story collection lined up for October! Usually some early 20th or 19th century stories that rarely disappoint. Have read some great collections the last couple years, and now excited to finally dive into some Algernon Blackwood.\n\n- **The Moonstone by Wilkie Collins (1868)** - I've read Wilkie Collins's Woman in White and The Dream Woman during past Octobers, so figured I'd do the Moonstone too. Not sure it'll fit the season as well as the other two I've read, but figured I'd continue the tradition!\n\n- **Moon of the Turning Leaves by Waubgeshig Rice (2023)** - Looking forward to a great, seasonal apocalyptic slow burn. \n\n- **Pine by Francine Toon (2020)** - Was one of my backup reads last year, so hoping to get to it this year instead.\n\n\n**What about you?

The plague brings death and suffering but also shows our protagonist, Anna, that she's capable of more than being a peasant miner's wife. As the plague upends old social conventions she develops an unlikely friendship with a noblewoman, Elinor, over their shared passion for understanding how the plague spreads.\n\nOr at least, *Elinor* talks about their shared passion. Anna thinks about it a lot, but rarely voices that, or indeed says anything interesting at all.\n\nHere's a typical \"conversation\" between the two (emphasis mine):\n\n>I looked at Elinor when she was attired in her miner's kit and wondered again about the strange turns this year was bringing us to. **She seemed to catch my thought** and laughed at herself. \"All those ancestors who stared at me from their portraits when I was a girl -- all those silken ladies and beribboned men -- I wonder what they'd say about their descendent if they could see her now?\" I did not tell her that I knew quite well what my Sam would say...\n\nThis follows the usual pattern: Anna thinks something, Elinor responds as if she said it out loud, and then Anna thinks a response.\n\nAnd it isn't just this one book: once you start noticing it, it's everywhere. Even in truly excellent books, like Donna Tartt's *The Goldfinch*, we have a cast of colorful characters with great dialogue, and a protagonist who technically speaks but very rarely drives the conversation or says the most interesting things on his mind.\n\nI sort of understand why this happens: because we have access to the MC's thoughts, we don't *need* them to speak to know what's going on.

I have seen it called plotless, or about tennis, but not really about tennis. A campus novel. After reading Roadside Picnic, I saw it referred to as a book with dystopian scifi area. There are as many people say they cannot get past page 100, as say it is the best thing they've ever read.\n\nMy take? This is a book about obsession, compulsion, addiction, discipline, loneliness, and intelligence all in one, and their unifying interrelatedness. It is about how drug addiction, sports ambition, and patriotism are children of the same impulse. How entertainment and elitism are born from the same wellspring. That Ambition = Obsession = Addiction = Entertainment, and they all exist just to distract us from existential Boredom.\n\nI strongly disliked reading Gravity's Rainbow, but even in that distaste, I recognised the work of a hyper detail-oriented polymath, and the novel at least culminates the very literal arc of the story.\n\nI did not dislike reading most of Infinite Jest. The writing was easier, the insights into human nature more compelling, the thematic parallels between the various vignettes more apparent as the novel progressed.\n\n(Mild spoilers for the structure of the ending:)\n\nThe only way I can make sense of this novel's abrupt and unfulfilling ending is in a meta way, where James Incandenza's filmography is representative of Wallace and this novel. JOI started in obsession with a technical aspect of filmmaking (lenses) similarly to how DFW seems obsessively preoccupied with grammar. JOI's early work involved a lot of technical and documentarian work, as DFW was also an essay writer and literature teacher.\n\nAs JOI developed his own artistic work, it was speculated whether it was artistically transgressive (anti-confluential?) or just poor editing, as can be said for DFW. Ultimately, his final work was a desperate drive to connect with and communicate with people, and entertain, as it widely seems DFW was trying to. In the end, Infinite Jest V was offically never seen, never finished, never released, just as the \"end\" of Infinite Jest is not present in these pages, at the risk that it would he \"so entertaining\" that one would never leave it; a tongue in cheek promise (An unfinished masterpiece can also be extrapolated to The Pale King).\n\nIt is also, as is, the Ultimate Anti-Entertainment; the ultimate demand of your active attention, the ultimate repudiation of the passive TV consumption which DFW fears so much.", "date_utc": 1758924279.0, "title": "Reading Infinite Jest in 30 Days: my thoughts on The (Anti)Entertainment", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "score": 128, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1nredip/reading_infinite_jest_in_30_days_my_thoughts_on/"}, {"id": "1nsxr60", "name": "t3_1nsxr60", "content": "", "date_utc": 1759088946.0, "title": "Does Kamala Harris\u2019 memoir actually read \u2018like a suspense novel\u2019?

The premise taps into a universal feeling of regret and offers a comforting thought experiment about letting go of the \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d\n\nThe initial chapters leading up to the suicide do a great job conveying the disorienting isolation, shame and hoplessness the protagonist feels (should definitely come with a trigger warning.) For people who struggle with regrets, its message, that different choices would not necessarily lead to better outcomes, can feel cathartic. Overall the novel is accessible, digestible and uplifting. \n\nThat said the  story itself is predictable and repetitive with clunky writing in places. The ending is obvious as soon as the plot opens up and in the pursuit of appealing to the lowest common denominator the story becomes painfully simple and mediocre. At its weakest, its message risks sounding like \u201cjust choose not to be depressed,\u201d which may feel reductive or even harmful for people suffering from depression not dependent on external factors. Derivative of Charles Dickens\u2019s novella *A Christmas Carol* (1843) and the movie *Its A Wonderful Life*(1946), the preachy tone of the novel works best as a fable with a \u201cmoral of the story is\u2026\u201d attached rather than as literary fiction. \n\nWhether it feels profound or painfully obvious depends on how much you see yourself in the main character's struggle.

The premise is simple yet profound: A house built by two runaway lovers in the wilderness becomes the silent witness to the passing of time. Across generations, its walls shelter Puritan settlers, artists, fugitives, revolutionaries, farmers, scientists, dreamers and spectral presence(s). Their stories forgotten by people but remembered in vivid detail by the land. \n\nWhat makes the novel compelling is its structure. Instead of focusing on one protagonist, Mason lets the house itself bind the narrative. Each chapter shifts its form (eg. letters, songs, field notes, ghost stories), while also bringing a fresh kaleidoscopic perspective, sometimes through the eyes of human characters, other times from the experience of animals, insects or plants, lending the story an immersive ecological depth. The house in the woods becomes a living character itself, witnessing love, envy, betrayal and loss, embodying both sanctuary and confinement. The result is less about plot in the traditional sense and more about the interconnection of time, nature and the human experience. \n\nMason's poetic prose skillfully blends historical fiction with elements of Gothic mystery and magical realism adding an otherworldly feel without overwhelming the grounded emotional reality of the characters. One of its strongest aspect is the seamless integration of human history with natural cycles, raising profound questions about the fragility and resilience of life. While the pacing may feel slow at moments due to its vast time span and reflective style, the book\u2019s multi-voiced structure, literary ambition and deep empathy for its characters make it a strikingly original unforgettable reading experience, rich with insight and beauty.\n\nHighly recommended for readers who love sweeping historical fiction, lyrical nature descriptions, ghostly atmosphere and inventive storytelling that lingers long after the last page. Daniel Mason has confirmed his status as a master storyteller in my heart with this profound and haunting work, definitely making the top 5 among the 50 odd books I have read this year. \n\n8.5/10\n", "date_utc": 1758722484.0, "title": "North Woods by Daniel Mason, a review.", "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "score": 188, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1npcyfg/north_woods_by_daniel_mason_a_review/"}, {"id": "1np82jp", "name": "t3_1np82jp", "content": "", "date_utc": 1758707914.0, "title": "The Booker shortlist honors authors 'in total command' of their craft", "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "score": 217, "url": "https://www.npr.org/2025/09/23/nx-s1-5550983/booker-prize-shortlist-2025"}, {"id": "1nqfnmr", "name": "t3_1nqfnmr", "content": "Yesterday I finally read The Shepherd\u2019s Crown, Terry Pratchett\u2019s final book, published posthumously after he died in 2015. I\u2019m a die-hard fan of his and have probably read 20+ of his books, starting mostly when I was seventeen. I found them extremely funny and insightful, and most of why I put off reading The Shepherd\u2019s Crown was because I didn\u2019t want to admit there wasn\u2019t gonna be any more of the story set after that. I found the basic shape of the book very entertaining, and while I can tell it suffered from not getting the rewrites it needed before Pterry\u2019s unfortunate passing, nothing dragged it down enormously, and if anything it metatextually enhanced the themes.\u00a0\n\nThat said, I\u2019ve spent a lot of today looking up old Discworld stories, and after those and Crown, I\u2019m finding myself not liking the material as much as I did before. 80% of it is still the same, but 20% - a leading 20% - feels worse. The central moral thesis to a lot of Pterry\u2019s work - that people suck but you still oughta do the right thing anyway - isn\u2019t coming across as genuinely noble and principled like it did before. It\u2019s coming across as holier-than-thou and above-the-rest in-universe.\u00a0\n\nI used to like the Tiffany Aching books, but skimming them again today, they came across as stuck-up and ignorant. The thesis of being a witch, it seems - as seen in Weatherwax and then Tiffany - is that it\u2019s such a damn burden being so much smarter than everyone, but that\u2019s your cross to bear, and isn\u2019t it such a shame no one will ever properly listen to you, you\u2019ll just have to keep on being smarter than everyone and only that exclusive circle of people like you will get to know it too. It\u2019s self-martyring shit - casting yourself as a persecuted problem-solver so you don\u2019t actually have to try harder to teach people even when they don\u2019t want to be taught. But you do get a sense of moral superiority that helps exactly no one!\u00a0\n\nI find myself repulsed, which is weird, because I\u2019ve always liked Tiffany Aching! I used to want to use her as a role model for my nieces, but I look at her now and I don\u2019t want to, because her life now seems immersed in this kind of emotional stinginess and misplaced priorities that I don\u2019t want my nieces to follow.\u00a0\n\nHas anyone experienced something like this when it comes to Pterry material? A disillusionment with the themes as they get older?\u00a0\n\nI should clarify, I\u2019m a millennial, I\u2019m past 25 now. I\u2019ve gotten out of the house a lot more since I started reading Pterry and I\u2019ve lost a lot of the grimdark cynicism I had as a teenager. On the other hand, I might be too young to get this. Maybe this is speaking to something that really was more of an issue in past generations when the Internet and social media weren\u2019t connecting people and when you were smart you *were* isolated and felt persecuted. Maybe Pterry was just more emotionally frustrated than I thought. Can anyone speak to this? Their own experience over the years?\u00a0\n\nSigned, a concerned fan.\u00a0\n\n**Tl;dr - I read a full Pratchett for the first time in ten years, and kind of hate one of his central moral theses now.

This book. Just wow. Boy's Life is one of the most magnificent books I've ever read, and might be the best book I've read this year.

Heck, in my opinion, this is a book that could be read in literature classes because of the depth it has with its themes. Boy's Life is a beautiful book, oftentimes bizarre, but magical the entire time. About 30 pages into the book, I already had the feeling that this one was going to be special, and the book proved me correct. Boy's Life pulls elements from a lot of different places: it has elements of southern gothic like Flannery O'Connor, coming of age themes and concepts of race and human dignity like in To Kill A Mockingbird, and also moments of horror similar to Stephen King. One of my favorite parts about this book was this overwhelming sense of nostalgia and childhood that suffuses the entire novel. I found myself reflecting on my own childhood and what it means to grow up, and wow, so many of the scenes just kept sticking with me the entire time I read this and they'll continue to stay with me long after. McCammon's character development is on a masterclass level here, his prose is stunning and is capable of weaving so many threads together, there are many emotional moments and I was moved to tears multiple times during my read, and I don't even know what else to say other than I LOVED this book.

And don\u2019t take me wrong, Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s prose has a very good flow and is very dynamic; however, the topic was not *it.* His style of writing is very easy to read and follow, but the book itself never grabs you.\n\nThis book is Mr. Stevens\u2019 memoir written during his 3-day trip along the English country. Mr. Stevens is an old-fashioned butler in a post-war house in England. It could be said that he was the best butler of his time: a devoted butler who sacrificed everything in his life to make sure he was doing his job with dignity and to serve his lord. He was extremely proud of his job as a butler and of the state the house was at. He even believed he had an impact in the world-affairs: big world leaders would meet at Darlington Hall to make decisions regarding the war, and Mr. Stevens believed details such as the silverware affected this meetings. He rejected a family to serve his lord, and was even humiliated in a couple of occasions. He was often made fun of by the leaders that visited the house, just to prove that the everyday man is dumb. And instead of being humiliated he felt proud of being able to serve his lord. His sacrifice went as far as to keep serving his lord the day that Mr. Stevens\u2019 father passed away. When the doctor came to see his dad, Mr. Stevens insisted the doctor should take care of one of the guests of the banquet instead.\n\nThe book revolves around Mr. Stevens\u2019 reflexions about what being a good butler is, all things he did as a butler that make a difference between a good butler and a bad butler. The book gets tedious when the butler describes in detail his staff organization, the special dust-sheeting the unoccupied wings should get, the handmaids shifts, and so on.\n\nApparently Darlington Hall was one of the most successful houses in the prewar period. However, Lord Darlington fell out of the grace of the public eye when his relationships with the Germans were discovered during the war (apparently he was trying to get Hitler and the prime minister to meet). Stevens was such a loyal servant that when hinted about this, he believed his Lord Darlington was right and people just could not understand it. After the war ended, Lord Darlington passed away and the house was bought by an American Mr. Faraday. Mr. Faraday did not have as much guests as Lord Darlington back in the day, so the job was easier. Nevertheless, Stevens started noticing he was committing more mistakes, and it should be added that they were really small mistakes, not noticed by Mr. Faraday. But Stevens is an over-analyst, and however small the mistake was, he would analyze it to death. He noticed how Faraday would make comments expecting a witty response or banter from Stevens, and Stevens not being used to that would be silent. So Stevens started practicing his \u201cwitticisms\u201d daily.\n\nThe real action of the book is Stevens trip driving his boss\u2019s Ford to Cornwall to visit the former Darlington Hall housekeeper, Miss Kenton. Miss Kenton was Stevens\u2019 colleague, and he made sure to keep the relationship a working one. Apparently she tried to flirt with Stevens and admired him, but he was just to busy to notice. Eventually she met Mr. Benn and left after marrying him.\n\nAfter a three day trip they meet in Cornwall at a hotel, and Miss Kenton tells Stevens about her marriage, how she didn\u2019t love Mr. Benn at first, but she was running out of time to marry and have children. After having her daughter, she started loving her husband and being happier. But she still thinks about what could have been if her and Stevens had been a thing. The purpose of the trip was also to try and convince Miss Kenton to go back to Darlington Hall to work, since her letters made it seem like she had problems in her marriage. But it turned out everything was ok.\n\nThe climax of the book comes at the end, when Mr. Stevens is thinking and sees the lights turn on giving a beautiful spectacle. Someone tells him the evening is the best part of the day, and everyone is waiting for the evening to see the lights. He starts talking with someone, and tells him how he gave everything for Lord Darlington, and how now he was starting to commit mistakes. The person he was talking to told him to just enjoy, as he was now in the most expected part of the life: the evening, so he should embrace and live the remains of the day.", "date_utc": 1758673095.0, "title": "The Remains of the Day - Kazuo Ishiguro", "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "score": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1noxwsv/the_remains_of_the_day_kazuo_ishiguro/"}, {"id": "1nnpt70", "name": "t3_1nnpt70", "content": "Depending on where you live, it might be hard to actually read banned or controversial books, but if you've read any - what book stood out to you? \n\nI enjoy reading books that are controversial or banned in other countries, I believe they are important to read - partly because no book should be banned and partly because it is the controversial topics that usually lead to a difference, be it in society or in your way of thinking.

It\u2019s rare that I encounter something so inherently irritating to me but still so intriguing. When I read the first chapter of the book I felt like this book would not be for me. I described these feelings in a previous reddit post ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ni9nx5/my_thoughts_on_the_prologue_of_the_remains_of_the/)). However, and almost in spite, I kept reading and could not put it down. I wanted to see what was up with this silly butler, and what antics his utter devotion to his job would get him into. It really goes to show how impressive Ishiguro is that he keeps the reader so enticed, even through these negative feelings. The back of the book does little, I believe, to really prepare you for the contents of it. This book isn\u2019t just a short trip through the English countryside. It\u2019s a deep introspection on this particular man\u2019s life, and how his personal philosophy and dedication to his role as a butler shapes the rest of his existence. When reading the comments on my last reddit post. I got the sense that he would \u201clearn something\u201d by the end of the book, that he would somehow change as a character. Guys, he doesn\u2019t really change at all. His last few lines still show that he is first and foremost a butler, and that any personal interest he has must first be sieved by his butler role. There are hints here and there that maybe he will change, but it seems evident that he will continue to rely his personal self worth in how good of a butler he is or isn\u2019t.\u00a0\n\nThere are some truly beautiful parts of this book. I found that the most interesting, engaging parts were when his butler duties were put in conflict against what would seem to be his personal interests. The best example of this are his recollections of some of his proudest days in the Salisbury chapter. In this chapter he pushes through the emotional turmoil from his complicating relationship with Ms. Kenton and his father dying of\u00a0 a stroke to serve guests who could have a large impact on world affairs. He seems to associate this as his proudest day because, in spite of his beloved father dying and diminishing relationship with his good friend Ms. Kenton, he fulfills his role as a butler exceptionally. This chapter blew me away. It describes the utter dedication Mr. Stevens has to his work, the seemingly valid reasons for why he lives that way, and the tragedy that is being unable to tend to his own personal affairs in sacrifice to his work.\u00a0\n\nI like this book. I do not like the main character. I sympathize and root for him however. I want him to live a happy life. I want him to find fulfillment. The way he chooses to seek fulfillment is through his dedication to his role. I think he is extremely misguided, but I still wish him the best. I got really pissed off in the way he ended his cocoa relationship with Ms. Kenton, even when she tried to reignite this routine with him, he stubbornly pushed away one of the only close friends he had for almost nothing. It was pure stupid, and hardly even in the interest of \u201cbeing a good butler.\u201d I think a lot of people who read this book don\u2019t seem to feel me on this point. I think it\u2019s okay to admit that Mr. Stevens is a pathetic, misguided, silly little guy. In fact, I\u2019m almost sure that this is the point. We are supposed to feel sorry for him, and maybe decide that his lifestyle is not one that we want to partake in.\n\nI think part of me feels that this book isn\u2019t meant for me. I\u2019m not the audience the author wanted to reach. I don\u2019t subscribe to the old ways of English classism, I\u2019m not one to dedicate myself so fully to a role that I lose myself in it. I don\u2019t really feel like I\u2019m walking away from this book having learned something important or profound. I\u2019m just thankful that I am already the way that I am. The book was worth the read though. Its technique and style is really something to behold, and will be something I compare future books to.\u00a0\n\n8/10.

Buehlman blends real medieval history with supernatural horror, creating a world where humanity\u2019s suffering mirrors a cosmic battle between heaven and hell. It is dark, atmospheric and firmly rooted in medieval brutality. Full disclosure: The book goes heavy on religious Christian themes. \n\nBuehlman\u2019s prose is one of the book\u2019s biggest strengths. He writes with a lyrical poetic touch that still manages to capture the grit and filth of the era. The characters are written with enough depth, warmth, humanity and biting humour that its easy to become emotionally invested in their struggles even amid the bleakness of the world around them. Dialogue feels authentic without being overly archaic and his descriptions of both the plague-ridden countryside and moments of supernatural terror are vivid and haunting. The pacing and tone are deliberately uneven, certain passages are dense and slow, making the raw and shocking moments stand out. \n\nPick it up if you are drawn to dark, atmospheric tales that mix history with the supernatural, where diseased landscapes, questions of faith and glimpses of hope intertwine. Its not flawless, on a couple occasions the book does stumble under the weight of its ambition, but its vivid writing, memorable characters and unsettling blend of horror and humanity make for a compelling rewarding read. \n\n8/10", "date_utc": 1758529100.0, "title": "Between Two Fires by Christopher Buehlman, a review.", "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "score": 43, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1nngrlr/between_two_fires_by_christopher_buehlman_a_review/"}, {"id": "1nmx05j", "name": "t3_1nmx05j", "content": "Normally, I like the books that has too much sadness, inner conflicts and situations that makes you feel there is no way out and all the life has to offer is endless pain and suffering.
