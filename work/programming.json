That is where *Microlits* come in.\n\nThey are a special kind of a (micro)service:\n\n>A microlith is basically a service that is designed using the independent module design principles which avoids calls between modules/services while processing an external request. This typically requires some status and data reconciliation mechanism between services to propagate changes that affect multiple microliths. The reconciliation mechanism must be temporally decoupled from the external request processing.\n\nHaving separated the processing of the external request and the communication between *Microliths*, we can split our monolithic application in several smaller parts without being hit by most of the distributed systems *Complexity*.\n\nThe tradeoff is that we have to pay the price of temporally decoupled reconciliation between the *Microliths*.

I built a RAG system for my company's internal knowledge. It was a classic, by-the-book setup. I fed it all our Confluence docs, PDFs, and text files. It was great.\n\n Then, in a demo, my boss asked me to search for and showcase some details from a video session held in the past week My RAG system was stumped. It hit me: I hadn't built a company brain. I'd built a text-only library. My AI was blind and deaf to the 80% of our knowledge that's in videos, audio files, and images. So, I started over.\n\n Here's the architecture I'm building out now.\n\n **The Core Idea: Multi-Modal Embeddings** We're all used to text embeddings, but new multi-modal models (like CLIP, or the newer ones) can map *different* media into the same \"meaning\" space. This means the *text* \"a red dog\" and a *photo* of a red dog become very similar, numerically. This is the key. \n\n**The** ***Real*** **Work: The Indexing Pipeline**  You can't just \"embed\" a video file.\n\n1.  **Audio/Video:** First, I run every file through **Whisper** to get a high-quality transcription *with precise timestamps*. This is non-negotiable. \n2. **Intelligent Chunking:** I learned this the hard way. Don't just split by 60-second intervals. You'll cut sentences in half. I'm using **PySceneDetect** to find *actual scene changes* in the video. This gives me much more logical, semantically meaningful \"chunks\" to embed. \n3. **Storing:** For each chunk, I'm storing the transcript, the text vector, the start/end timestamps, and the original file path.\n\n **Hybrid Retrieval (Don't Just Vector Search!)**  If you just do a pure vector search for \"Ghaziabad factory,\" you'll get 10 clips of the same 5-minute meeting segment. It's a terrible user experience. \n\nThe *real* solution is **Hybrid Retrieval**: \n\nFilter First (The \"Where\") and Vector Search Second (The \"What\") \n\nThis approach is 100x faster and more accurate. I'm now working on the re-ranking step (because the top 5 results are still often too similar), but this new architecture is already so much more powerful. We're finally building a system that can actually see and hear.\n\n I wrote up a full, 10-minute deep-dive on the entire architecture, some sample code for the hybrid pipeline. You can read it here: [article](https://ai.gopubby.com/multi-modal-rag-in-2025-how-clip-whisper-and-openai-embeddings-are-redefining-ai-search-a1fe1ce08825?source=friends_link&sk=d301a2e1c916afe4f0d421efa0fc13b4) \n\nI'm really curious: how are you all handling this?

All the usual gates were green:\n\n* Unit tests passed\n* Integration tests passed\n* Staging looked fine\n* Human code review did not flag anything\n\nThe change looked harmless. The AI had \u201coptimised\u201d payment processing by calling their analytics service synchronously instead of queueing events.\n\nIn tests, the analytics service was mocked and responded instantly.

When your service needs to connect to another service, it has to resolve the hostname to an IP address. In most programming languages, this happens through a synchronous system call like\u00a0`getaddrinfo()`. That means the thread making the request just sits there, doing nothing, waiting for the DNS response.\n\nNormally this takes 2-5 milliseconds and nobody notices. You have a thread pool of 200 threads, each request takes maybe 50ms total, and you\u2019re processing thousands of requests per second without breaking a sweat. The occasional DNS lookup is just noise in the overall request time.\n\nBut when DNS gets slow, everything changes. Imagine your DNS resolver is now taking 300ms to respond. Every thread that needs to establish a new connection is now blocked for 300ms just waiting for DNS. During that time, incoming requests pile up in the queue. More threads pick up queued requests, and they also need new connections, so they also get stuck on DNS. Before you know it, your entire thread pool is blocked waiting for DNS responses, and your service is effectively dead even though your CPU is at 15% and you have plenty of memory.\n\n[https://howtech.substack.com/p/dns-resolution-delay-the-silent-killer](https://howtech.substack.com/p/dns-resolution-delay-the-silent-killer)\n\n[https://github.com/sysdr/howtech/tree/main/dns\\_resolution](https://github.com/sysdr/howtech/tree/main/dns_resolution)", "date_utc": 1763136472.0, "title": "DNS Resolution Delay: The Silent Killer That Blocks Your Threads", "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "score": 90, "url": "https://howtech.substack.com/p/dns-resolution-delay-the-silent-killer"}, {"id": "1ox0p66", "name": "t3_1ox0p66", "content": "Apparently supply chain security has finally made it to the OWASP Top Ten!", "date_utc": 1763136696.0, "title": "Supply Chain Security made the OWASP Top Ten, this changes nothing", "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "score": 66, "url": "https://anchore.com/blog/supply-chain-security-made-the-owasp-top-ten-this-changes-nothing/"}, {"id": "1oy5yvp", "name": "t3_1oy5yvp", "content": "", "date_utc": 1763248654.0, "title": "Gamification of Programming Languages", "upvote_ratio": 0.29, "score": 0, "url": "https://sigusr2.net/gamification-of-programming-languages.html"}, {"id": "1oy5t9l", "name": "t3_1oy5t9l", "content": "", "date_utc": 1763248243.0, "title": "Patterns for faster python code", "upvote_ratio": 0.41, "score": 0, "url": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2025/11/10-smart-performance-hacks-for-faster-python-code/"}, {"id": "1oxabav", "name": "t3_1oxabav", "content": "", "date_utc": 1763158532.0, "title": "The Complexity of Simplicity", "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "score": 12, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cum5uN2634o"}, {"id": "1oy5tcs", "name": "t3_1oy5tcs", "content": "", "date_utc": 1763248249.0, "title": "Small functions considered harmful", "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "score": 0, "url": "https://copyconstruct.medium.com/small-functions-considered-harmful-91035d316c29"}, {"id": "1ow61vh", "name": "t3_1ow61vh", "content": "", "date_utc": 1763052349.0, "title": "IBM Patented Euler's 200 year old Math Technique", "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "score": 1156, "url": "https://leetarxiv.substack.com/p/ibm-patented-eulers-fractions"}, {"id": "1oxxyxj", "name": "t3_1oxxyxj", "content": "", "date_utc": 1763228796.0, "title": "Code Mode: the better way to use MCP", "upvote_ratio": 0.4, "score": 0, "url": "https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode/"}, {"id": "1owcbc7", "name": "t3_1owcbc7", "content": "", "date_utc": 1763066389.0, "title": "Rust in Android: move fast and fix things", "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "score": 247, "url": "https://security.googleblog.com/2025/11/rust-in-android-move-fast-fix-things.html"}, {"id": "1owzfjp", "name": "t3_1owzfjp", "content": "", "date_utc": 1763133901.0, "title": "How we avoided side-channels in our new post-quantum Go cryptography libraries", "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "score": 6, "url": "https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/11/14/how-we-avoided-side-channels-in-our-new-post-quantum-go-cryptography-libraries/"}, {"id": "1ow476v", "name": "t3_1ow476v", "content": "", "date_utc": 1763048121.0, "title": "Why agents DO NOT write most of our code -

Generation is controlled by parameters (temperature, top\u2011k, top\u2011p, do\\_sample) and can be completely disabled.\n\nThe most time\u2011consuming engineering work involved keeping theme and density consistent across diverse desktop environments, packaging and code signing (especially on macOS), and carefully integrating local cryptography plus authorization abstractions without letting external libraries leak through architectural layers.

If you add the Interface segregation principle, and the Open/closed principle, and you compare how easily achieved this is in OO versus FP, you realise that OO is the by far worst paradigm to achieve SOLID.\n\nLet me elaborate; Once you have a class in OO that only has **one single responsibility**, you've basically created a *\"badly implemented function\"*, since single responsibility in OO basically to some extent is the **very definition** of what a single function is, and you typically end up with one interface for every method you need to expose to other parts of your code. So why not use FP instead ...?\n\nIn OO, by following Single responsibility, you're basically ending up creating 3 times as much code compared to FP, and 3 times as many files too, reducing your ability to maintain your software over time. You end up with *\"soaking wet code\"*, because you always have to repeat your **\\*structure\\***...\n\nOO dev heads will scream out of the top of their lungs that their coworkers must use interfaces. Well, what is an interface? It's just a signature really, of input and output. Every single function in FP that takes a function by reference is *\"doing the same thing\"*.\n\nExcept with FP you can create *\"an interface\"* with a single line of code. With OOP you need at least 3 different files; The client code, the interface, and the implementation. In FP it's as simple as creating a function taking another function by reference, and as long as the signature matches, it will happily use your function *\"polymorphistically\"* without knowing anything about its implementation.\n\nBasically, regardless of which part of our work you study, you will slowly realise over time that you're basically stuck in a *\"cargo cult\"*, where instead of asking ourselves what **works**, we spend most of our time with *\"rituals\"*, we have absolutely no scientific data to claim is helping us in any ways what so ever.\n\nI could go on and demolish every single *\"good idea\"* we've collectively had since GoF came out with their infamous book in 1995. Is this something I'm alone with feeling ...?\n\nIn the above video, I'm talking about how it's literally **\\*impossible\\*** to create DRY code while following SOLID. And not for the reasons you think, but rather because you have two DRY axis; Structure and code. If you choose to follow SOLID, you end up with *\"wet\"* code, because you have to repeat your **\\*structure\\*** every single time you do **\\*anything\\*** ...", "date_utc": 1762586637.0, "title": "How Single Responsibility proves that OOP is madness", "upvote_ratio": 0.17, "score": 0, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCRqXpRUD2k"}, {"id": "1oqikpn", "name": "t3_1oqikpn", "content": "# The Problem That Keeps System Architects Awake\n\n>\n\n# What Is a Dead Letter Queue?\n\n>", "date_utc": 1762482577.0, "title": "Day 26: The Dead Letter Queue Pattern", "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "score": 11, "url": "https://javatsc.substack.com/p/day-26-the-dead-letter-queue-pattern"}, {"id": "1org0cj", "name": "t3_1org0cj", "content": "Ever wondered how much of your app you actually wrote?

I sketched something out and then just kinda let it sit. I picked it up again a few weeks ago and made a complete-ish backend for both x86 and ARM64. It has no dependencies, the backends are completely autogenerated (by horrible, horrible JS scripts), and I built a small abstraciton layer for things like functions prologues etc.\n\nIt\u2019s super duper early and will probably break on your machine, but it\u2019s good enough to compile some cool examples (look at the [examples directory](https://github.com/hellerve-pl-experiments/cj/tree/master/examples), my personal favorite is the [minimal language implementation](https://github.com/hellerve-pl-experiments/cj/blob/master/examples/minilang.c)).\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have anything except basically a fancy JIT assembler with some helpers as of yet. No register allocator, a lot of ABI details will still have to be figured out manually (though of course feel free to add anything to the abstraction layer that\u2019s generally useful and submit a PR!).\n\nI honestly don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going with this next.

I knew vector indexes were fundamentally different from B-trees, hash maps, GIN indexes, etc., but I had not understood that they were essentially incompatible with more standard filtering approaches in the way that they are typically executed.\n\nI searched through google until page 10 and beyond with various different searches, but struggled to find thorough examples addressing the issues I was facing in real production scenarios that I could use to ground my expectations and guide my implementation.\n\nNow, I wrote a blog post about some of the best practices I learned for filtering vector queries using pgvector with PostgreSQL based on all the information I could find, thoroughly tried and tested, and currently in deployed in production use. In it I try to provide:\n\n\\- Reference points to target when optimizing vector queries' performance  \n\\- Clarity about your options for different approaches, such as pre-filtering, post-filtering and integrated filtering with pgvector  \n\\- Examples of optimized query structures using both Python + SQLAlchemy and raw SQL, as well as approaches to dynamically building more complex queries using SQLAlchemy  \n\\- Tips and tricks for constructing both indexes and queries as well as for understanding them  \n\\- Directions for even further optimizations and learning\n\nHopefully it helps,

It's been kinda frustrating but also really rewarding, going from just using these tools to actually getting how they're built.\n\n## The Starting Point: From Confusion to Curiosity\n\nSo I started out using Cursor everyday, you know, just like everyone else. Then I heard about Claude Code and thought I'd give it a shot. But the more I used these tools, the more I realized - they're basically magic to me. I had no clue what was happening under the hood.\n\nThat's when I got really curious. I didn't want to just be another user anymore, I actually wanted to understand the principles behind how coding agents work.\n\n## The Learning Path: Struggling Between Two Extremes\n\nSo I started looking for resources to learn, and I found this weird gap in what's available. It's like everything is either super basic or ridiculously complex.\n\n**On the basic side:**\n- I found tutorials like \"Building an Agent\" (ampcode.com) which were actually pretty good to get started\n- But they're basically just demos, you know? Like they show you the basics but you're still missing the bigger picture\n- After finishing them, I was like \"ok, but how do you actually build something real with this?\"\n\n**On the complex side:**\n- I dove into open-source projects like reverse-engineered Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Crush, Neovate Code\n- These are the real deal - production tools that people actually use\n- But holy crap, the codebases are massive (we're talking tens of thousands of lines) and the architecture is just overwhelming\n- For someone trying to learn, it's almost impossible to figure out what's actually important vs what's just implementation details\n\nI felt really stuck. I wanted to understand how these things actually work, but everything was either too simple to be useful or too complex to learn from.\n\n## The Turning Point: The Answer Was to Build It Myself\n\nAfter being stuck for a while, I had this thought - what if I just built one myself?\n\nI wasn't trying to create the next big thing or compete with existing tools. I just wanted to:\n- Build something that was complete but not overwhelmingly complex\n- Actually understand what each part does and how they connect\n- Get the core patterns without all the extra production complexity\n\n## What I Actually Learned from Building It\n\nHonestly, implementing this myself was when things finally clicked for me.\n\n**LLM and Tool Integration**\n- Figuring out how to actually make LLMs call tools reliably\n- What to do with tool results and how to handle errors\n- When to run things in parallel vs when to do them one by one\n\n**Why MCP Actually Matters**\n- Before I thought MCP was just more complexity, but then I got why we need standard ways for tools to talk to each other\n- How to make different services work together without going crazy\n- Why extensibility is actually important even in small projects\n\n**Human-in-the-Loop Stuff**\n- When you actually need to ask the user for input vs when you can just do things automatically\n- How to make confirmation flows that don't annoy people\n- The balance between automation and keeping humans in control\n\n**Putting It All Together**\n- Configuration management, permissions, sessions - all the boring but necessary stuff\n- Error handling (so much error handling...)\n- Making both a CLI and an interactive UI that actually work together\n\n## What Actually Clicked for Me\n\nThe biggest things I realized:\n\n1. **Complexity comes in layers** - you can't really understand this stuff until you see all the different levels and why each one exists\n2. **Actually building it is way better than reading about it** - I learned more from a few weeks of coding than months of reading tutorials\n3. **The sweet spot is balance** - you need something complete enough to be real, but simple enough to actually understand\n\n## If You're Trying to Learn This Stuff Too\n\nFor anyone else going down this rabbit hole, here's what worked for me:\n\n- Don't just use the tools - try to understand what's actually happening\n- The middle ground is hard to find - most stuff is either \"hello world\" or production-scale complexity\n- Build your own version, even if it's simple - you'll learn SO much\n- Focus on the \"why\" more than the \"how\" - the architectural decisions are more important than the specific code\n\nThis whole experience didn't just teach me how coding agents work - it actually changed how I think about building complex systems in general.\n\n---\n\nAnyway, if anyone's interested in seeing what a middle-ground implementation looks like, I put my project up on GitHub: https://github.com/minmaxflow/mini-kode\n\nIt's basically my attempt to create something that fills that gap between simple demos and crazy complex production systems. It's around 14K lines of code - enough to be useful and complete, but not so much that your brain explodes trying to understand it.

It would creep up for days and then crash. I'd internally blame V8, thinking the garbage collector was just \"being slow\" or \"missing things.\" I was completely wrong. The GC wasn't the problem; my code was.\n\nThe V8 garbage collector is an incredibly optimized piece of engineering. It's just a system with a clear set of rules. The problem was my code was breaking those rules.\n\n I realized that the GC is designed for two different scenarios:\n\n1. **New Space (Scavenger):** A high-speed cleanup crew for *short-lived* objects (like variables in a function). It's fast and efficient.\n2. **Old Space (Mark-Sweep):** A slower, more methodical crew for *long-lived* objects (like global singletons, caches).\n\nMy code was causing leaks by actively sabotaging this system:\n\n* **Problem 1: GC Thrashing.** I had a `data.map()` in a hot path that created thousands of new objects per request. My code was flooding the New Space, forcing the high-speed \"Scavenger\" to run constantly, burning CPU.\n* **Problem 2: Accidental Promotions.** I had a simple per-request cache that I forgot to clear. V8 saw these temporary objects being held onto, so it assumed they were \"long-lived\" and **promoted them to the Old Space.** My temporary garbage was now in the permanent file cabinet, leading to the slow memory creep.\n* **Problem 3: The Closure Trap.** I had an event listener whose callback only needed a `userId` but was accidentally holding a reference to the *entire* 10MB user object. The GC did its job and kept the object alive (because my code told it to).\n\nOnce I learned these rules, I was able to solve the problem of regular crashing for that server.\n\nI wrote a full deep-dive on this. It covers how the GC actually works, how to spot these code anti-patterns, and the practical \"3-snapshot technique\" for finding the *exact* line of code that's causing your leak.\n\n**You can read the full guide here:** [article](https://medium.com/codetodeploy/de-mystifying-the-v8-garbage-collector-how-your-code-is-sabotaging-your-apps-memory-c290f80eb1d0?source=friends_link&sk=fc1c16b78a846500f40de8539dba7332)", "date_utc": 1761906078.0, "title": "How my Node.js code was causing a massive memory leak and how I solved it", "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "score": 108, "url": "https://medium.com/codetodeploy/de-mystifying-the-v8-garbage-collector-how-your-code-is-sabotaging-your-apps-memory-c290f80eb1d0?source=friends_link&sk=fc1c16b78a846500f40de8539dba7332"}, {"id": "1olcdwq", "name": "t3_1olcdwq", "content": "", "date_utc": 1761962309.0, "title": "Industry GC Insights from OpenJDK", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "score": 4, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLNFVNXbw7I"}, {"id": "1ol71dt", "name": "t3_1ol71dt", "content": "", "date_utc": 1761946719.0, "title": "On Developers in C-Level Meetings", "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "score": 10, "url": "https://radekmie.dev/blog/on-developers-in-c-level-meetings/"}, {"id": "1okzgsu", "name": "t3_1okzgsu", "content": "For those who don't know about C3: it is a general purpose language that strives to be an evolution of C.\n\nThe 0.7.7 release among other things changes the vector ABI to pass SIMD vectors as arrays by default, which opens up ABI compatibility with C libraries that uses structs for things like vectors.

It's notoriously difficult and expensive. (If it was easy and cheap, we might be able to use to validate some AI-generated code.)\n\nOver the last month, I used ChatGPT-5 and Codex (and also Claude Sonnet 4.5) to validate a (hand-written) algorithm from a Rust library. The AI tools produced proofs that a proof-checker called Lean, checked. Link to full details below, but here is what surprised me:\n\n* **It worked**. With AI\u2019s help and without knowing Lean formal methods, I validated a data-structure algorithm in Lean.\n* Midway through the project, Codex and then Claude Sonnet 4.5 were released. I could\u00a0*feel*\u00a0the\u00a0**jump in intelligence**\u00a0with these versions.\n* I began the project unable to read Lean, but with AI\u2019s help I learned\u00a0**enough to audit**\u00a0the critical top-level of the proof. A reading-level grasp turned out to be all that I needed.\n* The\u00a0**proof was enormous**, about 4,700 lines of Lean for only 50 lines of Rust. Two years ago, Divyanshu Ranjan and I\u00a0validated the same algorithm with 357 lines of Dafny.\n* Unlike Dafny, however, which relies on randomized\u00a0SMT\u00a0searches, Lean builds explicit step-by-step proofs. Dafny may mark something as proved, yet the same verification can fail on another run. When Lean proves something, it\u00a0**stays proved**.\u00a0*(Failure in either tool doesn\u2019t mean the proposition is false \u2014 only that it couldn\u2019t be verified at that moment.)*\n* The AI tried to\u00a0**fool me twice**, once by hiding\u00a0sorrys with\u00a0set\\_option, and once by proposing axioms instead of proofs.\n* The validation process was\u00a0**more work and more expensive**\u00a0than I expected. It took several weeks of part-time effort and about $50 in AI credits.\n* The process was still\u00a0**vulnerable to mistakes**. If I had failed to properly audit the algorithm\u2019s translation into Lean, it could end up proving the wrong thing. Fortunately, two projects are already tackling this translation problem:\u00a0coq-of-rust, which targets Coq, and\u00a0Aeneas, which targets Lean. These may eventually remove the need for manual or AI-assisted porting. After that, we\u2019ll only need the AI to write the Lean-verified proof itself, something that\u2019s beginning to look not just possible, but practical.\n* **Meta-prompts worked well**. In my case, I meta-prompted browser-based ChatGPT-5. That is, I asked it to write prompts for AI coding agents Claude and Codex. Because of quirks in current AI pricing, this approach also helped keep costs down.\n* The resulting proof is almost certainly\u00a0**needlessly verbose**. I\u2019d love to contribute to a Lean library of algorithm validations, but I worry that these vibe-style proofs are too sloppy and one-off to serve as building blocks for future proofs.\n\n**The Takeaway**\n\nVibe validation is still a dancing pig. The wonder isn\u2019t how gracefully it dances, but that it dances at all. I\u2019m optimistic, though. The conventional wisdom has long been that formal validation of algorithms is too hard and too costly to be worthwhile.

It also supports Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing to check share validity securely.\n\n**What my project does**\n\nBasically you have a secret(a password, a key, an access token, an API token, password for your cryptowallet, a secret formula/recipe, codes for nuclear missiles). You can split your secret in n shares between your friends, coworkers, partner etc. and to reconstruct your secret you will need at least k shares. For example: total of 5 shares but you need at least 3 to recover the secret). An impostor having less than k shares learns nothing about the secret(for context if he has 2 out of 3 shares he can't recover the secret even with unlimited computing power - unless he exploits the discrete log problem but this is infeasible for current computers). If you want to you can not to use this Feldman's scheme(which verifies the share) so your secret is safe even with unlimited computing power, even with unlimited quantum computers - mathematically with fewer than k shares it is impossible to recover the secret\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Minimal deps (pycryptodome), pure Python.\n* File or variable-based workflows with Base64 shares.\n* Easy API for splitting, verifying, and recovering secrets.\n* MIT-licensed, great for secure key management or learning crypto.\n\nComparison with other implementations:\n\n* pycryptodome - it allows only 16 bytes to be split where mine allows unlimited(as long as you're willing to wait cause everything is computed on your local machine). Also this implementation does not have this feature where you can verify the validity of your share. Also this returns raw bytes array where mine returns base64 (which is easier to transport/send)\n* [This](https://github.com/thedanhub/shamir-secret-sharing)\u00a0repo allows you to share your secret but it should already be in number format where mine automatically converts your secret into number. Also this repo requires you to put your share as raw coordinates which I think is too technical.\n* Other notes: my project allows you to recover your secret with either vars or files. It implements Feldman's Scheme for verifying your share. It stores the share in a convenient format\u00a0*base64*\u00a0and a lot more, check it out for docs\n\n**Target audience**\n\nI would say it is production ready as it covers all security measures: primes for discrete logarithm problem of at least 1024 bits, perfect secrecy and so on.\u00a0**Even so, I wouldn't recommend its use for high confidential data(like codes for nuclear missiles) unless some expert confirms its secure**\n\nCheck it out:\n\n* PyPI:\u00a0[https://pypi.org/project/shamir-lbodlev/](https://pypi.org/project/shamir-lbodlev/)\u00a0(pip install shamir-lbodlev)\n* GitHub:\u00a0[https://github.com/lbodlev888/shamir](https://github.com/lbodlev888/shamir-lbodlev)\u00a0(README with examples)\n\n\\-Feedback or feature ideas?

It's not that \"velocity,\" \"data-first,\" or \"business-value\" are new, but their prioritization and implementation in this context are highly non-obvious.\n\nThese are the 5 key \"refinements\" we focused on that ultimately led to our success:\n\n- It's a Data & Product Problem First. We had to shift focus from pure algorithm/infrastructure elegance to the speed and quality of our user data feedback loops. This was the #1 unlock.\n- Velocity Unlocks Correctness. We prioritized a scrappy, end-to-end working pipeline to get A/B data fast. This validation loop allowed us to find correctness, rather than just guessing at it in isolation.\n- Business Impact is the North Star. We moved away from treating offline metrics (like nDCG) as the goal. They became debugging tools, while the real north star became a core business KPI (engagement, retention, etc.).\n- Blurring Lines Unlocks Synergy. We had to break down the rigid silos between Data Science, Backend, and Platform.

This isn't a browser; it's an *agent platform*. [Article](https://medium.com/ai-advances/openai-atlas-beyond-the-browser-window-unpacking-agentic-web-ai-memories-the-future-of-7a1900fe0999?sk=f86d5cadb904bb8aae15458cfcc71e72)\n\nThe two things that matter are:\n\n1. **\"Browser Memories\":**  It's an optional-in feature that builds a personal, queryable *knowledge graph* of what you see. You can ask it, \"Find that article I read last week about Python and summarize the main point.\" It's a persistent, long-term memory for your AI.\n2. **\"Agent Mode\":** This is the part that's both amazing and terrifying. It's an AI that can *actually click buttons and fill out forms* on your behalf. It's not a dumb script; it's using the LLM to *understand* the page's intent.\n\nThe crazy part is the security. OpenAI openly admits this is vulnerable to \"indirect prompt injection\" (i.e., a malicious prompt hidden on a webpage that your agent reads).\n\nWe all know about \"Agent Mode\" the feature that lets the AI autonomously navigate websites, fill forms, and click buttons. But *how* does it know what to click? It's not just using brittle selectors. It's using the LLM to *semantically understand* the DOM. And the single best way to give it unambiguous instructions? **ARIA tags.** That `<div>` you styled to look like a button? The agent might get confused. But a `<button aria-label=\"Submit payment\">`? That's a direct, machine-readable instruction.\n\nAccessibility has always been important, but I'd argue it's now mission-critical for \"Agent-SEO.\" We're about to see a whole new discipline of optimizing sites for AI agents, and it starts with proper semantic HTML and ARIA.\n\nI wrote a deeper guide on this, including the massive security flaw (indirect prompt injection) that this all introduces. If you build for the web, this is going to affect you.\n\n[link](https://medium.com/ai-advances/openai-atlas-beyond-the-browser-window-unpacking-agentic-web-ai-memories-the-future-of-7a1900fe0999?sk=f86d5cadb904bb8aae15458cfcc71e72)", "date_utc": 1761552158.0, "title": "OpenAI Atlas \"Agent Mode\" Just Made ARIA Tags the Most Important Thing on Your Roadmap", "upvote_ratio": 0.24, "score": 0, "url": "https://medium.com/ai-advances/openai-atlas-beyond-the-browser-window-unpacking-agentic-web-ai-memories-the-future-of-7a1900fe0999?sk=f86d5cadb904bb8aae15458cfcc71e72"}, {"id": "1ogv0u2", "name": "t3_1ogv0u2", "content": "", "date_utc": 1761510455.0, "title": "How Engineering Teams Set Goals and Measure Performance", "upvote_ratio": 0.31, "score": 0, "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFJVscftavs"}, {"id": "1ogebwp", "name": "t3_1ogebwp", "content": "I built GlobalCVE \u2014 a free, open-source CVE search engine and API that unifies data from NVD, CIRCL, JVN, ExploitDB, CVE.org, and enriches results with KEV and GitHub advisories.\ud83d\udd0d Live site: globalcve.xyz  \ud83d\udcbb GitHub: github.com/globalcve It\u2019s designed for local deployment, with a clean UI, reproducible backend, and a focus on security and transparency.
